Each ``.mp`` file (with the exception of ``crfuncs.mp``) must be run through
``mpost``.

After this step, the resulting ``.mps`` (metapost-flavored encapsulated
postscript) files can either be directly ``\includegraphics``-ed within the
\*TeX markup, or each can be converted to a pdf file using ``mptopdf``.


``mpost`` is part of the Metapost CTAN package and available f.e. through
texlive. ``mptopdf`` is available through texlive, too.
