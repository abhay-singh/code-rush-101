Contributing to Crypto 101
==========================

First of all, thanks for contributing!

Please consider filing separate tickets for separate issues. Having
many different comments stuck on a single issue makes it extremely
difficult to discuss them separately. This doesn't count for obviously
wrong things like markup, grammar or spelling errors.

Screenshots demonstrating issues are extremely helpful and highly
encouraged.

When mentioning page numbers, please use the page numbers that are
noted on the page itself. This can be different from the page that a
PDF reader thinks you're on due to cover pages.

Feel free to submit pull requests, although all of the above counts as
well.

Style guide
===========

Pronoun gender
--------------

Use gender-neutral pronouns where appropriate. For example, when
talking about an attacker, use "they", "them", et cetera instead of
"he" and "him" or "she" and "her".

When talking about specific people, use the gender pronoun they
prefer. Also use gendered pronouns when using placeholder names like
Alice, Bob, Carol. Mallory could be of either gender, but she's a girl
in Crypto 101.
