| ★★★ |
 <a href="http://www.vim.org/download.php">
  Vim
 </a>
 | CLI / Cross-Platform | Vim is one of the most popular text editors among advanced programmers. It allows text-editing to be done very efficiently with solely keystrokes. Vim is also highly configurable, extensible and integrates with shells (command lines) really well. The only setback about Vim is that it has a high learning curve for beginners. |
| ★★★ |
 <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/download.html">
  Emacs
 </a>
 | CLI / Cross-Platform | Emacs is another popular text editor (or development environment to be more precise). The debate on "Vim vs. Emacs" is constantly brought up due to their popularity. Basically Emacs is more than just a text editor. It has plugins like file managers, web browsers, mail clients and news clients that allows users to performs these tasks directly inside Emacs. Emacs is "heavier" because of this, but it arguably has a relatively easier learning curve for beginners. |
| ★★★ |
 <a href="http://www.farmanager.com/download.php?l=en">
  Far Manager
 </a>
 | Hybrid / Windows | Far Manager is the most widely-used editor in the RU/CIS competitive programming community. It's actually a file manager in its bare bones, but you can install

| ★★★ |
 <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/#chooseYourEdition">
  IntelliJ IDEA

 <a href="https://eclipse.org/downloads/">
  Eclipse
 </a>
 | GUI / Cross-Platform | Eclipse is another good IDE for Java. It's an okay alternative to Intellij IDEA (A tad inferior to IDEA by today's standards). Sometimes contests only provide Eclipse for some reason, so this might be a good incentive to try and use Eclipse. |
| ★★☆ |
 <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/download/">
  CLion

 | GUI / Cross-Platform | CLion, produced by JetBrains - the same company who made Intellij IDEA, is a powerful IDE for C++. Free educational licenses are available OR you can try out their
