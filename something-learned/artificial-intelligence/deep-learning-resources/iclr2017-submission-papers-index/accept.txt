The idea of learning the parameters of a state estimation system, even if it is a simple example like a histogram filter, is an interesting idea from both the ML and robotics perspectives.\n \n However, I think it's also fairly clear (from the reviews if nothing else), that substantial additional work needs to be done if this paper is to convey these ideas clearly and impactfully to the ICLR community. The value of the histogram filter may be obvious to the robotics community (though even there it seems like it would be worth pursuing the extension of these ideas to the case e.g. of particle filters), as these have historically been an important conceptual milestone in robotic perception, but the examples shown in this paper are extremely simplistic. Given that histogram filters inherently scale poorly with dimension, it's not clear from this paper itself why the techniques show particular promise for scaling up to realistic domains in the future.\n \n Pros:\n + Interesting idea of using training a state estimator end-to-end for robotics tasks\n \n Cons:\n - Histogram filters, while well-motivated historically from the robotics standpoint, are really toy examples at this point except in a very small number of settings.\n - The results aren't all that compelling, showing modest improvement (over seemingly not-very-tuned alternatively approaches), on fairly simple domains."},"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false},{"ddate":null,"cdate":null,"tddate":null,"tcdate":1486396703457,"number":1,"tmdate":1486396703457,"id":"B1wXTGIdl","invitation":"ICLR.cc/2017/conference/-/paper606/acceptance","forum":"r1YNw6sxg","replyto":"r1YNw6sxg","signatures":["ICLR.cc/2017/pcs"],"readers":["everyone"],"writers":["ICLR.cc/2017/pcs"],"content":{"title":"ICLR committee final decision","comment":"All reviewers viewed the paper favourably, although there were some common criticisms.

The empirical section of the paper is largely focused on benchmarking logistic regression models on MNIST, which reviewers find underwhelming. It is conceivable that the results reflect performance on real hardware, but the ICLR community would atleast expect to see realistic deep learning workloads on larger datasets such as Imagenet, where scalability challenges have been throughly studied. Without such results, the impact of the contribution is hard to evaluate and the claimed gains are bit of a leap of faith. \n \n The authors make several good points in their response about the paper - that their method is expected to scale, that high quality simulations can given insights that can inform hardware manufacturing, and that their approach complements other hardware and algorithmic acceleration strategies.

The task that the authors are trying to evaluate is especially hard; in fact, it is not even clear to me how humans make these judgments. The low kappa scores on some of the non-\"overall\" dimensions, and only moderate agreement on \"overall,\" are quite worrisome. What makes a good \"chat\" dialogue? The authors seem not to have qualitatively grappled with this key question, rather defining it empirically as \"whatever our human judges think it is.\" This is, I think the deepest flaw of the work; the authors are rushing to automate evaluation without taking the time to ponder what good performance actually is. \n \n That aside, I think the idea of automatic evaluation as a modeling problem is worth studying. The authors note that this has been done for other problems, such as machine translation. They give only a cursory discussion of this prior work, however, and miss the seminal reference, \"Regression for sentence-level MT evaluation with pseudo references,\" Albrecht, Joshua, and Rebecca Hwa, ACL 2007.\n \n The paper would be much stronger with some robustness analysis; does the quality of the evaluation hold up if the design decisions are made differently, if less data are used to estimate the evaluation model, etc.? How does it hold up across datasets, and across different types of dialogue systems? As a methodological note, there are a lot of significance tests here and no mention of any attempt to correct for this (e.g., Bonferroni, FDR, etc.).\n \n As interesting as the ideas here are, I can't see the dialogue community rushing to adopt this approach to evaluation based on the findings in this paper. I do think that the ideas it presents should be hashed out in a public forum sooner rather than later, and therefore recommend it as one of a few papers to be presented at the workshop.","decision":"Invite to Workshop Track"},"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false},{"ddate":null,"cdate":null,"tddate":null,"tcdate":1486396699384,"number":1,"tmdate":1486396699384,"id":"B1m7TzLdg","invitation":"ICLR.cc/2017/conference/-/paper599/acceptance","forum":"HJrDIpiee","replyto":"HJrDIpiee","signatures":["ICLR.cc/2017/pcs"],"readers":["everyone"],"writers":["ICLR.cc/2017/pcs"],"content":{"decision":"Reject","title":"ICLR committee final decision","comment":"The reviewers agree that the paper is clear and well-written, but all reviewers raised significant concerns about the novelty of the work, since the proposed algorithm is a combination of well-known techniques in reinforcement learning.

There are several character-aware language models which obtain robust results on LM data which could readily be adapted to sentence representation learning, eg.

This method allows the model to utilize a cache-like mechanism, simply by storing previous states. Everyone agrees that this roughly works (although there could be stronger experimental evidence), and provides long-term memory to simple models. Reviewers/authors also agree that it might not work as well as other pointer-network like method, but there is controversy over whether that is necessary. \n \n - Further discussion indicated a sense by some reviewers that this method could be quite impactful, even if it was not a huge technical contribution, due to its speed and computational benefits over pointer methods. \n \n - The clarity of the writing and good use of references was appreciated \n \n - This paper is a nice complement/rebuttal to \"Frustratingly Short Attention Spans in Neural Language Modeling\".\n \n Including the discussion about this paper as it might be helpful as it was controversial: \n \n \"\"\"\n The technical contribution may appear \"limited\" but I feel part of that is necessary to ensure the method can scale to both large datasets and long term dependencies. For me, this is similar to simpler machine learning methods being able to scale to more data (though replacing \"data\" with \"timesteps\"). More complex methods may do better with a small number of data/timesteps but they won't be able to scale, where other specific advantages may come in to play.\n \n (Timesteps)\n \n Looking back 2000 timesteps is something I've not seen done and speaks to a broader aspect of language modeling - properly capturing recent article level context. Most language models limit BPTT to around 35 timesteps, with some even arguing we don't need that much (i.e. \"Frustratingly Short Attention Spans in Neural Language Modeling\" that's under review for ICLR). From a general perspective, this is vaguely mad given many sentences are longer than 35 timesteps, yet we know both intuitively and from the evidence they present that the rest of an article is very likely to help modeling the following words, especially for PTB or WikiText.\n \n This paper introduces a technique that not only allows for utilizing dependencies far further back than 35 timesteps but shows it consistently helps, even when thrown against a larger number of timesteps, a larger dataset, or a larger vocabulary. Given it is also a post-processing step that can be applied to any vaguely RNN type model, it's widely applicable and trivial to train in comparison to any more complicated models.\n \n (Data)\n \n Speaking to AnonReviewer1's comment, \"A side-by-side comparison of models with pointer networks vs. models with cache with roughly the same number of parameters is needed to convincingly argue that the proposed method is a better alternative (either because it achieves lower perplexity, faster to train but similar test perplexity, faster at test time, etc.)\"\n \n Existing pointer network approaches for language modeling are very slow to train - or at least more optimal methods are yet to be discovered - and has such limited the BPTT length they tackle. Merity et al. use 100 at most and that's the only pointer method for language modeling attending to article style text that I am aware of. Merity et al. also have a section of their paper specifically discussing the training speed complications that come from integrating the pointer network. There is a comparison to Merity et al. in Table 1 and Table 2.\n \n The scaling becomes more obvious on the WikiText datasets which have a more realistic long tail vocabulary than PTB's 10k. For WikiText-2, at a cache size of 100, Merity et al. get 80.8 with their pointer network method while the neural cache model get 81.6. Increasing the neural model cache size to 2000 however gives quite a substantial drop to 68.9. They're also able to apply their method to WikiText-103, a far larger dataset than PTB or WikiText-2, and show that it still provides improvements even when there is more data and a larger vocabulary. Scaling to this dataset is only sanely possible as the neural cache model doesn't add to the training time of the base neural model at all - that it's equivalent to training a standard LSTM.\n \"\"\"","decision":"Accept (Poster)"},"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false},{"ddate":null,"cdate":null,"tddate":null,"tcdate":1486396662289,"number":1,"tmdate":1486396662289,"id":"SJCeTGU_g","invitation":"ICLR.cc/2017/conference/-/paper533/acceptance","forum":"Sk2Im59ex","replyto":"Sk2Im59ex","signatures":["ICLR.cc/2017/pcs"],"readers":["everyone"],"writers":["ICLR.cc/2017/pcs"],"content":{"title":"ICLR committee final decision","comment":"The authors propose a application of GANs to map images to new domains with no labels.

By exploiting a continuous stack in the vein of Das et al. 1992, Joulin and Mikolov 2015, or Grefenstette et al. 2015 (any of which could plausibly have been used here, by my reading, contrary to claims made by the authors in discussion), they can model nested calls with a stack-like structure which needs only partial supervision of a few full traces. The claim is that the resulting model is more sample efficient than the NPI of Reed and de Freitas.\n \n The reviews are mixed. R1 is grumpy about citations, which I see as grounds for rejection, but raises the point that the claims to data efficiency may be overblown since it is only shown that few full traces are needed to train the model, not that it can infer structure without full traces, which would be more impressive. Confusingly, they refer to continuous stacks as probabilistic, which is misleading as while there is (in all variants mentioned above) a possible probabilistic interpretation of non-{0, 1} push/pop operations, the updates to the stack state are deterministic, as are all other aspects of the network except test-time sampling of actions from the multivariate distribution induced by the softmax on output.\n \n R2 has not understood the paper or background material if they mistakenly believe that the stack-like structure and resulting model are probabilistic, as there is no sampling of actions on the stack, but only deterministic state updates. The superficiality of the review combined with the fairly crucial misunderstanding sadly means I cannot rely on it to make a recommendation.\n \n R3 is broadly sympathetic to the paper, while recognising that it still requires information about the program structure through partial FULL supervision in order to learn to manipulate the continuous stack (and thus nested function calls). It is disappointing that the authors did not reply to this point in this review. I acknowledge that they address this claim in part in a response to R1, but the reply is mostly that they will rewrite the formulation of their claims.\n \n Overall, the novelty of this paper lies in the integration of an existing flavour of differentiable data structure, variants of which have recently been presented at NIPS in 2015, into NPI in order to learn program structure. This would have made for an excellent paper if this augmentation had shown that, without partial supervision on the stack operations (thus training solely from low level traces) the model had been able to infer program structures. The need to provide some full traces is disappointing in this respect, although the claim about providing a more data-efficient training regime thanks to the data structure is plausible. \n\nStil, overall, the PCs encourage the authors to address the remainig issues in the camera reasy version of their paper and to present this as a poster at the main conference.","decision":"Accept (Poster)"},"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false},{"ddate":null,"cdate":null,"tddate":null,"tcdate":1486396647165,"number":1,"tmdate":1486396647165,"id":"Hk1xafIdx","invitation":"ICLR.cc/2017/conference/-/paper512/acceptance","forum":"rJTKKKqeg","replyto":"rJTKKKqeg","signatures":["ICLR.cc/2017/pcs"],"readers":["everyone"],"writers":["ICLR.cc/2017/pcs"],"content":{"title":"ICLR committee final decision","comment":"Reviewers found this work to be a \"well-motivated\", \"good contribution\", and \"clever\".

The method is a nice contribution to the \"learning to learn\" framework, and actually was developed simultaneously to a few papers that have since already been published. It's definitely a useful addition to this space.\n \n The biggest issue with this paper is that the results simply aren't that compelling. The methodology and proposed approach is nice, and the text is improved upon a previous version posted to Arxiv, but it seems that for most problems the results aren't that much better than some of the more common off-the-shelf optimization approaches that _don't_ require learning anything. Furthermore, in the one domain where the method does seem to (marginally) outperform the other methods, the neural net domain, it's unclear why we'd want to use the proposed approaches instead of SGD-based methods and their like (which of course everyone actually does for optimization).\n \n Pros:\n + Nice contribution to the learning to learn framework\n + Takes a different approach from past (concurrent) work, namely one based upon policy search\n \n Cons:\n - Experiments are not particularly compelling\n \n Overall, this work is a little borderline.

The idea is straightforward and sensible: use a reinforcement learning strategy to iteratively grow a deep net graph (the space of actions is e.g. adding different layer types) via Q-learning. The reviewers agree that the idea is interesting, novel and promising but are underwhelmed with the execution of the experiments and the empirical results. \n \n The idea behind the paper and the formulation of the problem are quite similar to a concurrent submission (https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1Ue8Hcxg) which has much higher scores. That paper formulates their reinforcement learning strategy using the REINFORCE algorithm while this one uses Q-learning. The major discrepancy between the papers is in the execution of the experiments. This paper had a much more restricted set of experiments on a smaller search space and thus had less impressive results. The other paper explored a much larger space of architectures and explored recurrent neural networks, achieving state-of-the-art on multiple tasks and finding exciting novel architectures that challenge current standard models (LSTMs). As a result that paper received three 9's and this one three 6's.\n \n The authors argue that they had almost the same idea but did not have access to the same amount of computing resources as the other paper. That certainly is warranted as the other paper used an *extreme* amount of compute resources for their experiments. \n \n Given the average scores of ICLR and target acceptance rate, three 6s should normally be considered a reject. Specifically, in the absence of the other paper this would be rejected. However, the authors argue that this would be unfair, since the major difference was simply in compute resources. A major concern of the reviewers was that this approach was too computationally expensive, which is strongly contradictory to the scores for the other paper. In reality, the other paper really is just much more interesting because of the empirical results. However, I sympathize with the authors as the other paper essentially demonstrates that their idea is sensible and effective (albeit only with obscene compute resources), and the paper would effectively be \"scooped\" from further submissions.\n \n (Note a contrarian viewpoint might take an analogy from other fields. e.g. experimental physics papers are likely rejected if they don't have multi-billion dollar equipment to run the right set of exhaustive experiments, which is the difference between e.g. the large hadron collider and most university depts.)\n \n Pros:\n - The paper proposes a novel approach to architecture search using reinforcement learning\n - The approach is technically sound and interesting\n - The authors achieve good results automatically on benchmark tasks using their approach\n - They empirically demonstrate that their method works (via plots demonstrating the behavior of the algorithm while varying how exploratory the algorithm is)\n \n Cons:\n - The search space is very constrained (too much for us to learn anything interesting from the results)\n - The experimental results are good but underwhelming\n - Compared to e.g. Bayesian optimization methods, this approach seems very wasteful in compute resources (e.g. 1500 runs of training before the approach starts exploiting).\n \n The Program Chairs have also reviewed this paper, and taken everything into account, have reccommended this paper for poster presentation at the main conference.","decision":"Accept (Poster)"},"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false},{"ddate":null,"cdate":null,"tddate":null,"tcdate":1486396571561,"number":1,"tmdate":1486396571561,"id":"B1NinG8_l","invitation":"ICLR.cc/2017/conference/-/paper418/acceptance","forum":"Syoiqwcxx","replyto":"Syoiqwcxx","signatures":["ICLR.cc/2017/pcs"],"readers":["everyone"],"writers":["ICLR.cc/2017/pcs"],"content":{"decision":"Reject","title":"ICLR committee final decision","comment":"This paper analyzes under which circumstances bad local optima prevent effective training of deep neural networks.

In light of the discussions and the current state of the submission, the AC recommends rejection. \n \n Since the final scores of the reviewers might suggest otherwise, please let me explain my recommendation. \n \n The main contribution of this paper seems to be essentially a fast alternative to the method proposed in 'Adversarial Manipulation of Deep Representations', by Sabour et al, ICLR'16, although the lack of rigor and clarity in the presentation of section 3 makes this assessment uncertain. The most likely 'interpretation' of Eq (3) suggests that eta(x_o, x_t) = nabla_{x_o}( || f^(l)_w(x_t) - f^(l)_w(x_o) ||^2), which is simply one step of gradient descent of the method described in Sabour et al. One reviewer actually asked for clarification on this point on Dec. 26th, but the problem seems to be still present in the current manuscript. \n \n More generally, visualization and adversarial methods based on backpropagation of some form of distance measured in feature space towards the pixel space are not new; they can be traced back to Simoncelli & Portilla '99. \n Fast approximations based on simply stopping the gradient descent after one iteration do not constitute enough novelty. \n \n Another instance of lack of clarity that has also been pointed out in this discussion but apparently not addressed in the final version is the so-called PASS measure. It is not defined anywhere in the text, and the authors should not expect the reader to know its definition beforehand. \n \n Besides these issues, the paper does not contribute to the state-of-the-art of adversarial training nor feature visualization, mostly because its experiments are limited to mnist and face datasets.

The heuristics are intuitive: augmenting the dictionary size when correlation between reconstruction and inputs falls below a certain pre-determined threshold, reducing the dictionary size by adding a group-sparsity L1,2 penalty on the overall dictionary (the L1,2 penalty for pruning models had appeared elsewhere before, as the authors acknowledge).\n The topic of online adjustment of model complexity is an important one, and work like this is an interesting and welcome direction. The simplicity of the heuristics presented here would be appealing if there was more empirical support to demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed adaptation. However, the empirical validation falls short here:\n - the claim that this work offers more than existing off-line model adaptation methods because of its online setting is the crux of the value of the paper, but the experimental validation does not offer much in terms of how to adjust hyperparameters to a truly nonstationary setting. Here, the hyperparameters are set rather arbitrarily, and the experimental setting is a single switch between two datasets (where off-line methods would do well), so this obscures the challenges that would be presented by a less artificial level of non-stationarity\n - an extensive set of experiments is presented, but all these experiments are confined in a strange experimental setting that is divorced from any practical metrics: the \"state-of-the-art\" method of reference is Mairal et al 2009 which was focused on speeding learning of dictionaries. Here, the metrics offered are correlation / reconstruction error, and classification, over full images instead of patches as is usually done for large images, without justification. This unnecessarily puts the work in a vacuum in terms of evaluation and comparison to existing art. In fact, the reconstructions in the appendix Fig. 17 and 18 look pretty bad, and the classification performance 1) does not demonstrate superiority of the method over standard dictionary learning (both lines are within the error bars and virtually indistinguishable if using more than 60 elements, which is not much), 2) performance overall is pretty bad for a 2-class discrimination task, again because of the unusual setting of using full images.\n In summary, this paper could be a very nice paper if the ideas were validated in a way that shows true usefulness and true robustness to the challenges of realistic nonstationarity, but this is unfortunately not the case here.\n Ps: two recent papers that could be worth mentioning in terms of model adaptation are diversity networks for pruning neurons (Diversity Networks, Mariet and Sra ICLR 2016, https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.05077), and augmenting neural networks with extra parameters while retaining previous learning (Progressive Neural Networks, Rusu et al 2016, https://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.04671v3.pdf)."},"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false},{"ddate":null,"cdate":null,"tddate":null,"tcdate":1486396541698,"number":1,"tmdate":1486396541698,"id":"SkLF2M8_g","invitation":"ICLR.cc/2017/conference/-/paper364/acceptance","forum":"B1ckMDqlg","replyto":"B1ckMDqlg","signatures":["ICLR.cc/2017/pcs"],"readers":["everyone"],"writers":["ICLR.cc/2017/pcs"],"content":{"title":"ICLR committee final decision","comment":"The paper uses mixtures of experts to increase the capacity of deep networks, and describes the implementation of such a model on a cluster of GPUs.

The reviewers all agreed that the paper should be accepted and that it would be interesting and useful to the ICLR community.

For example, the claim that the proposed method is guaranteed to converge while \"methods that rely on these heuristics are not endowed with any\n theoretical consistency guarantees\" is weak. Any optimization method can trivially add this guarantee by adopting a simple strategy of adding a random experiment 1/n of the time (in fact, SMAC does this I believe). This claim is true of random search compared to gradient based optimization on non-convex functions as well, yet no one optimizes their deep nets via random search. Also, the authors claim to compare to state-of-the-art in hyperparameter optimization but all the comparisons are to algorithms published in either 2011 or 2012. Four years of continued research on the subject are ignored (e.g. methods in Bayesian optimization for hyperparameter tuning have evolved considerably since 2012 - see e.g. the work of Miguel Hern‡ndez Lobato, Matthew Hoffman, Nando de Freitas, Ziyu Wang, etc.).

The authors were responsive during the rebuttal phase and addressed most of the reviewers questions. \n \n The reviewers, however, disagree with the significance of this work. Whereas R4 is happy to see an established method (ADMM) applied to a nowadays very popular architecture, R1-R3 were skeptical about the scope of the experiments and the usefulness of the sparse approximation. \n \n Pros:\n - Simple algorithmic description using well-known ADMM method. \n - Consistent performance gains in small and mid-scale object classification problems. \n \n Cons:\n - Lack of significance in light of current literature on the topic. \n - Lack of numerical experiments on large-scale classification problems and/or other tasks.\n - Lack of clarity when reporting speedup gains. \n \n Based on these assessments, the AC recommends rejection. Since this decision is not 100% aligned \n with the reviewers, let me expand on the reasons why I recommend rejection. \n \n This paper presents a sound algorithm that sparsifies the weights of a trained-CNN, and it shows that \n the resulting pruned network works well, better than the original one. A priori, this is a solid result. \n My main problem is that this contribution has to be taken in the context of the already large body of \n literature addressing this same question, starting from the seminal 'Predicting Parameters in Deep Learning', by Misha Denil et al., NIPS 2013, which is surprisingly ignored in the bibliography here; and onwards with 'Exploiting linear structure within convolutional networks for efficient evaluation', Denton et al, NIPS'14 (also ignored) and 'Speeding up convolutional neural networks with low rank expansions', Jadergerg et al., '14. These and many other works culminated in two recent papers, 'Deep Compression', by Han et al, ICLR'16 and 'Learning Structured Sparsity in Deep Neural Networks' by Wen et al, NIPS'16.\n Several reviewers pointed out that comparisons with Wen et al were needed; the authors of the present submission now do cite this work, but do not compare their results quantitatively and do not present the reader with compelling reasons to choose their acceleration instead of Wen et al.'s. Moreover, they mention in the rebuttal that the paper was published after the submission, but the work was available on the arxiv well before the ICLR deadline (august 2016). Wen's paper presents (i) source code, (ii) experiments on imagenet, (iii) 3x to 5x speedups in both CPU and GPU, and (iv) accuracy improvements on Cifar of ~1.5%. As far as I can see, the present submission presents none of these. Further compression factors were obtained in 'Deep Compression', also in large-scale models. \n \n In light of these results, the authors should present more compelling evidence (in this case, since this is an experimental paper, empirical evidence in the form of higher accuracy and/or larger speedups/gains) as to why should a practitioner use their model, rather than simply presenting the differences between the approaches."},"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false},{"ddate":null,"cdate":null,"tddate":null,"tcdate":1486396524194,"number":1,"tmdate":1486396524194,"id":"HJV_hzL_x","invitation":"ICLR.cc/2017/conference/-/paper331/acceptance","forum":"Hkg4TI9xl","replyto":"Hkg4TI9xl","signatures":["ICLR.cc/2017/pcs"],"readers":["everyone"],"writers":["ICLR.cc/2017/pcs"],"content":{"title":"ICLR committee final decision","comment":"The paper presents an approach that uses the statistics of softmax outputs to identify misclassifications and/or outliers.

The reviewers are mixed in their opinions of the paper, but AnonReviewer4 brings up a point that deserves further attention: the analysis assumes that the same step-size is used for different mini-batch sizes. Because of this assumption, the conclusion of the paper is misleading. One of the effects of increasing the mini-batch is to decrease the variance of the estimator, which allows a larger step-size. With this larger step-size the net effect of increasing the mini-batch can actually be positive even in terms of the number of examples. Fixing the step-size removes the chance for the mini-batch strategy to do better in theory, and there is indeed a large amount of empirical evidence that mini-batches can lead to practical improvements.

The goal of this discussion is to help the authors leverage the community for improving their manuscript.\n \n Whilst one may argue that some of the initial reviews could have provided a more detailed motivation for their rating, there is no evidence that the reviewers were influenced (or even aware of) discussions about this paper on social or other media --- in fact, none of the reviews refers to claims made in those media. Suggestions by the authors that the reviewers are biased by (social) media are, therefore, unfounded: there can be many valid reasons for the differences in opinion between reviewers and authors on the novelty, originality, or importance of this work. The authors are free to debate the opinion of the reviewers, but referring to the reviews as \"absolute nonsense\", \"unreasonable\", \"condescending\", and \"disrespectful\" is not helping the constructive scientific discussion that ICLR envisions and, frankly, is very offensive to reviewers who voluntarily spend their time in order to improve the quality of scientific research in our field.\n \n Two area chairs have read the paper. They independently reached the conclusion that (1) the reviewers raise valid concerns with respect to the novelty and importance of this work and (2) that the paper is, indeed, borderline for ICLR. The paper is an application paper, in which the authors propose the firstÊend-to-end sentence level lip reading using deep learning. Positive aspects of the paper include:\n \n - A comprehensive and organized review about previous work.\n - Clear description of the model and experimental methods.\n - Careful reporting of the results, with attention to detail.\n - Proposed method appears to perform better than the prior state-of-the-art, and generalizes across speakers.\n \n However, the paper has several prominent negative aspects as well:\n \n - The GRID corpus that is used for experimentation has very substantial (known) limitations. In particular, it is constructed in a way that leads to a very limited (non-natural) set of sentences.Ê(For every word, there is an average of just 8.5 possible options the model has to choose from.)\n - The paper overstates some of its claims. In particular, the claim that the model is \"outperforming experienced human lipreaders\" is questionable: it is not unlikely that model achieves its performance by exploiting unrealistic statistical biases in the corpus that humans cannot / do not exploit. Similarly, the claims about the \"sentence-level\" nature of the model are not substantiated: it remains unclear what aspects of the model make this a sentence-level model, nor is there much empirical evidence that the sentence-level treatment of video data is helping much (the NoLM baseline is almost as good as LipNet, despite the strong biases in the GRID corpus).\n - The paper makes several other statements that are not well-founded. As one of the reviewers correctly remarks, the McGurk effect does not show that lipreading plays a crucial role in human communication (it merely shows that vision can influence speech recognition). Similarly, the claim that \"Bi-GRUs are crucial for efficient further aggregation\" is not supported by empirical evidence.\n \n A high-level downside of this paper is that, while studying a relevant application of deep learning, it presents no technical contributions or novel insights that have impact beyond the application studied in the paper."},"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false},{"ddate":null,"cdate":null,"tddate":null,"tcdate":1486396447353,"number":1,"tmdate":1486396447353,"id":"ByvQhz8Oe","invitation":"ICLR.cc/2017/conference/-/paper229/acceptance","forum":"BJ8fyHceg","replyto":"BJ8fyHceg","signatures":["ICLR.cc/2017/pcs"],"readers":["everyone"],"writers":["ICLR.cc/2017/pcs"],"content":{"title":"ICLR committee final decision","comment":"The reviewers generally liked the application; there were a number of technical points raised that leave doubt about the novelty of the approach.

The idea here is to use an RNN to solve tasks in an MDP, and then use a higher level RL algorithm (TRPO) to learn the parameters of this RNN. It's an interesting idea, and one that I think fits in well to a lot of current work on learning methods for optimizing policies.\n \n However, there are a few drawbacks to this paper. First, I believe that the paper is substantially lacking from the point of view of clarity, an assertion that I think is backed up by the three reviewers. Most of the methods are never formally defined, and only a high level description of the actual algorithm is provided. This was particularly confusing to me when reading through the paper, because the entire concept of the paper is suggesting that the authors are learning an RL-based policy. But it's really unclear to me why the \"fast\" RL policy should really be considered RL at all: it is just a black box policy modelled by an RNN, that the authors then argue exhibits similar behavior as RL algorithms when presented a new domain. This is perhaps a semantic point (maybe we should judge \"RL\" as virtually any algorithm that can improve over time when run in a domain), but this seems to be an odd distinction, because it certainly seems like the authors are just using TRPO to learn a policy (that happens to be in the form of an RNN). And given that plenty of existing work uses RNNs as policies (and then use an RL algorithm to tune these policies), it's unclear to me how this work differentiates itself, and why it necessitates some new conceptual approach, that specifies the policy itself as an RL algorithm (even if it acts as such in the simple bandit domain presented, for example, in the maze task it seems quite odd to cast this as anything but a policy learned for this domain).\n \n Pros:\n + Potentially nice contribution to the \"learning to learn\" field\n + Very nice experiments on the maze domain, highlighting a complex task\n \n Cons:\n - Algorithmic presentation is unclear\n - Difficult to see why this method necessitates some new conceptual framework like \"RL^2\": the authors seem to just be learning an RNN-based policy"},"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false},{"ddate":null,"cdate":null,"tddate":null,"tcdate":1486396443803,"number":1,"tmdate":1486396443803,"id":"SyEQhGIux","invitation":"ICLR.cc/2017/conference/-/paper223/acceptance","forum":"HJgXCV9xx","replyto":"HJgXCV9xx","signatures":["ICLR.cc/2017/pcs"],"readers":["everyone"],"writers":["ICLR.cc/2017/pcs"],"content":{"title":"ICLR committee final decision","comment":"pros:\n - demonstration that using teacher's feedback to improve performance in a dialogue system can be made to work \n  in a real-world setting\n - comprehensive experiments\n \n cons:\n - lack of technical novelty due to prior work\n - not all agree with the RL vs not-RL (pre-built datasets) distinction suggested in the paper with respect to the previous work\n \n Overall, the paper makes a number of practical contributions and evaluation, rather than theoretical novelty.","decision":"Accept (Poster)"},"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false},{"ddate":null,"cdate":null,"tddate":null,"tcdate":1486396442958,"number":1,"tmdate":1486396442958,"id":"Sy7Qhz8_x","invitation":"ICLR.cc/2017/conference/-/paper222/acceptance","forum":"B1ElR4cgg","replyto":"B1ElR4cgg","signatures":["ICLR.cc/2017/pcs"],"readers":["everyone"],"writers":["ICLR.cc/2017/pcs"],"content":{"title":"ICLR committee final decision","comment":"The reviewers were positive about this paper and agree that it will make a contribution to the community.","decision":"Accept (Poster)"},"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false},{"ddate":null,"cdate":null,"tddate":null,"tcdate":1486396442206,"number":1,"tmdate":1486396442206,"id":"rkzQ2GLdl","invitation":"ICLR.cc/2017/conference/-/paper221/acceptance","forum":"Hkz6aNqle","replyto":"Hkz6aNqle","signatures":["ICLR.cc/2017/pcs"],"readers":["everyone"],"writers":["ICLR.cc/2017/pcs"],"content":{"decision":"Reject","title":"ICLR committee final decision","comment":"The reviewers unanimously recommend rejecting this paper."},"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false},{"ddate":null,"cdate":null,"tddate":null,"tcdate":1486396441510,"number":1,"tmdate":1486396441510,"id":"H1bmhfLOg","invitation":"ICLR.cc/2017/conference/-/paper220/acceptance","forum":"rkE8pVcle","replyto":"rkE8pVcle","signatures":["ICLR.cc/2017/pcs"],"readers":["everyone"],"writers":["ICLR.cc/2017/pcs"],"content":{"title":"ICLR committee final decision","comment":" This paper is a clear accept.

Indeed, taking a step back and seeing whether we are able to learn meaningful relations is needed in order to build more complex systems.\n \n However, AR2 raised some important issues: 1) the paper is extremely toy; RN has a very simplistic structure, and is only shown to work on synthetic examples that to some extent fit the assumptions of the RN. 2) there is important literature that addresses relation representations that has been entirely overlooked by the authors. None of these concerns have been answered, and the authors have instead taken an approach to try to discard the reviewer, going as far as calling the review \"poor\". The AC does not agree that the reviewer miscategorized the paper as computer vision. The reviewer implied missed citations from a field that is all about learning object relations. In its current form, the paper does not have a review of related work. When brought up by the reviewer, the authors did not even try to do a search for the relevant literature (CV, genomics, etc -- fields which inherently deal with related problems, and have done involved analysis over the decades of existence). The AC does not see any citations in a discussion nor in the final revision. This is a major letdown. The reviewer also mentioned the fact that showing results on real datasets would strengthen the paper, which was also brought up by AR3. This indeed would have added value to the paper, although it is not a deal breaker.\n \n The reviewer AR2 did not engage in discussions, which indeed is not appropriate.

Furthermore the claim that Zaremba and Sutskever model homogenous, single-variable polynomial expressions. While it is true that the pseudo-python snippets used as input do seem to express polynomials, there is more to the problem then reading a polynomial and computing the answer (e.g. the for loops model folds). This makes us question whether or not the authors properly read this paper, which they allegedly draw their model's inspiration from, and consequently whether or not the reviewers properly read the paper under consideration as no one as picked up on this. Other parts of the paper also bother us, such as the somewhat poorly motivated claim that coercing the output of a sub-network be a unit vector my dividing it by its L2 norm is close to layer normalisation which is mathematically almost true, if the mean of of the activations is 0, and we accept a fixed offset in the calculation of the stddev, but conceptually a different form of normalisation. It is also curious that other methods of obtaining stable training in recursive networks, such as TreeLSTM (Zhu et al. 2015, Tai et al. 2015), were not compared to. None of these problems is particularly damning but it is surprising and disappointing not to see these issues discussed in the review process.\n \n Overall, the reviews, found the method proposed here sound, although some details lacked explanation. The consensus was that the general problem being addressed is interesting and timely, given the attention the topics of program induction and interpretation have been receiving in the community recently. There was also consensus that the setting the model was evaluated on was far too simple and unnatural, and that there is need for a more complex, task involving symbolic interpretation to validate the model. It is hard to tell, given all the design decisions made (l2-normalisation vs layer norm, softmax not working), whether the end product is tailored to the task at hand, and whether it will tell us something useful about how this approach generalises.

The model attempts to embed samples with visible labels into corresponding clusters, while embedding samples without labels close to some of the cluster centroids. Strong numerical results are reported on small-scale semi-supervised image tasks. \n \n The reviewers acknowledged the effectiveness of the method and the strong numerical results, but expressed concerns about the lack of originality with respect to previous works. \n \n The AC found the work pleasantly well presented and strikingly simple, yet with excellent numerical performance. These two qualities make this work actually refreshing relative to the ever-increasing complexity of current deep learning architectures. In particular, this seems to be the *proper* way to perform semi-supervised learning. \n However, the model appears extremely similar to [Grandvalet & Bengio, '04], not just in the entropy-minimization regularization for unlabeled examples, but also for the cross-entropy minimization of labeled examples and the semi-supervised objective. The only difference I perceive is that [G & B '04] present a generic recognition model p( z | x), whereas the present submission uses a classification layer of the form \n (1) p(z | x ) = softmax( -|| Phi(x) - Phi(y_k) ||^2 ), \n where the y_k are randomly chosen examples of class respectively k. p(z | x) is thus random relative to the choice of 'anchors' y_k. \n Thus, the present model is rather a particular case, unless I misunderstood. In that case, the main question is to understand how much the excellent numerical performance relies on this particular choice of classification layer. The numerical section should consider a baseline where (1) is replaced by a 'standard' classification softmax of the form p(z | x ) = softmax( < v_k, Phi(x) > ), where v_k are class-specific parameters. \n \n For these reasons,we recommend inviting this submission to the workshop track, and we encourage the authors to address the previous remark.","decision":"Invite to Workshop Track"},"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false},{"ddate":null,"cdate":null,"tddate":null,"tcdate":1486396388951,"number":1,"tmdate":1486396388951,"id":"H1aJhfLOe","invitation":"ICLR.cc/2017/conference/-/paper157/acceptance","forum":"B1akgy9xx","replyto":"B1akgy9xx","signatures":["ICLR.cc/2017/pcs"],"readers":["everyone"],"writers":["ICLR.cc/2017/pcs"],"content":{"decision":"Reject","title":"ICLR committee final decision","comment":"No reviewer was willing to champion the paper and the authors did not adequately address reviewer comments in a revision.

The paper argues that using a support based regularizer is superior to using a standard graph Laplacian regularizer (which has been explored before), although this argument is not developed particularly rigorously and dominantly has to fall back on empirical evidence. The main contribution of the paper appears to be theoretical justification of an alternating optimization scheme for minimizing the resulting objective function (yet the optimization aspects of dealing with a sparse support regularizer are somewhat orthogonal to the current context). The empirical results are not very convincing since the dictionary size is relatively large compared to the dataset size; the gains with respect to l2 manifold regularizer are not consistent; and the gains using deep architectures to directly predict sparse codes are also modest and somewhat inconsistent.

In presents some theoretical and experimental results supporting the parallelization strategy. The reviews are mixed and indeed a common concern among the reviewers was the choice of test problem. To me it is ok to only concentrate on a single class of problems, but in this case it needs to be a problem that the ICLR community identifies as being of central importance. Otherwise, if a more esoteric problem is chosen then I (and the reviewers) would rather see that the method is useful on multiple problems. Otherwise, it's basically impossible to extrapolate the experiments to new settings and we are forced to re-implement the algorithm. I'm not saying that the authors necessarily need to consider deep networks and there are many alternative possible models (sparse coding, collaborative filtering, etc.). But it should be noted that, without further experimental comparisons, it is impossible to verify the author's claims that the method is effective for deeply-nested models.\n \n Other concerns brought up by the reviewers (beyond the clarity/presentation issues, which should also be addressed): the experimental comparison would be more convincing with a comparison to an existing approach like a parallel SGD method. I appreciate that the authors have done a lot of work already on this problem, but doing such obvious comparisons should be the job of the author instead of the reader (focusing purely on parallelization would be ok if the MAC model was extremely-widely-used already and parallelizing was an open problem, but my impression is that this is not the case). As a minor aside, the memory issue will be more serious for deeply-nested models, due to the use of the decomposition approach (we don't want to store the activations for all layers for all examples), and this doesn't arise in SGD."},"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false},{"ddate":null,"cdate":null,"tddate":null,"tcdate":1486396366254,"number":1,"tmdate":1486396366254,"id":"HJ80sMLOl","invitation":"ICLR.cc/2017/conference/-/paper117/acceptance","forum":"rJo9n9Feg","replyto":"rJo9n9Feg","signatures":["ICLR.cc/2017/pcs"],"readers":["everyone"],"writers":["ICLR.cc/2017/pcs"],"content":{"decision":"Reject","title":"ICLR committee final decision","comment":"The program committee appreciates the authors' response to concerns raised in the reviews.

Since the only evaluation is on trajectory tracking, it's also not even clear (as pointed out by other reviewers) to what degree these results will generalize to other tasks. In fact, a contrarian view might be that PD tracking is specifically a good fit for trajectory tracking with a known reference trajectory, but might be a poor fit for accomplishing a particular task, where more open-loop behaviors might be more optimal. The passive compliance of MTUs is also shown to often not be beneficial, but it's again not clear whether this might in fact be an artifact of the trajectory tracking task.\n \n But perhaps more problematically, the primary conclusions of the paper are of limited relevance when it comes to design of algorithms or models (or at least, the authors don't discuss this), but are more relevant for practitioners interested in applying deep RL for learning controllers for articulated rigid body systems such as robots or virtual characters. As such, it's not clear what fraction of the ICLR audience will find the paper relevant to their interests.\n \n I would strongly encourage the authors to continue their research: there is a lot to like about the present paper, including an elegant reinforcement learning methodology, rigorous empirical results for the specific case of trajectory following, and some very nice videos and examples."},"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false},{"ddate":null,"cdate":null,"tddate":null,"tcdate":1486396326690,"number":1,"tmdate":1486396326690,"id":"HJk2szIdl","invitation":"ICLR.cc/2017/conference/-/paper50/acceptance","forum":"ryUPiRvge","replyto":"ryUPiRvge","signatures":["ICLR.cc/2017/pcs"],"readers":["everyone"],"writers":["ICLR.cc/2017/pcs"],"content":{"title":"ICLR committee final decision","comment":"This paper proposes using functions such as sin and cos as basis functions, then training a neural network with L1 regularization to obtain a simple estimate of functions that can extrapolate under some circumstances.\n \n Pros:\n - the paper has a wide-ranging discussion connecting extrapolation in regression problems to adjacent fields of system identification and causal learning.\n - the method is sensible enough, and should probably be a baseline in the time-series literature.

There were several concerns from reviewers, in three areas particularly: connection and comparison to related work; lack of clarity and understanding of the paper; experiments that are not sufficiently convincing. These have been addressed to some extent by the authors, discussing in more detail the related work, especially in connection to Rezende et al., and GSN of Bengio et al., and with improved figures. But these points are still of concern especially in terms of assessing sample diversity in relation to much of the recent work on richer variational posterior methods and other techniques. For these reasons, the paper is not yet ready for acceptance at this years conference."},"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false},{"ddate":null,"cdate":null,"tddate":null,"tcdate":1486396310057,"number":1,"tmdate":1486396310057,"id":"SkAcsG8de","invitation":"ICLR.cc/2017/conference/-/paper12/acceptance","forum":"S1di0sfgl","replyto":"S1di0sfgl","signatures":["ICLR.cc/2017/pcs"],"readers":["everyone"],"writers":["ICLR.cc/2017/pcs"],"content":{"title":"ICLR committee final decision","comment":"This extension to RNNs is clearly motivated, and the details of the proposed method are sensible.

Writing is very poor.\n \n However, just for playing devil's advocate, to the reviewers, I would like to point out that I am in agreement with the author that dynamic evaluation is not equivalent to this method. The weights are not changed in this model, as far as I can see, for the test set. Surprisal is just an extra input to the model. I think the reviewers were puzzled by the fact that at test time, the actual sequence needs to be known. While this may be problematic for generative modeling, I do not see why this would be a problem for language modeling, where the goal of the model is only to provide a log prob to evaluate how good a sequence of text is. Long before language modeling started being used to generate text, this was the main reason to use it - in speech recognition, spelling correction etc.."},"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false},{"ddate":null,"cdate":null,"tddate":null,"tcdate":1486396301571,"number":1,"tmdate":1486396301571,"id":"SJ8ciMIug","invitation":"ICLR.cc/2017/conference/-/paper1/acceptance","forum":"r1rhWnZkg","replyto":"r1rhWnZkg","signatures":["ICLR.cc/2017/pcs"],"readers":["everyone"],"writers":["ICLR.cc/2017/pcs"],"content":{"title":"ICLR committee final decision","comment":"The program committee appreciates the authors' response to concerns raised in the reviews.
