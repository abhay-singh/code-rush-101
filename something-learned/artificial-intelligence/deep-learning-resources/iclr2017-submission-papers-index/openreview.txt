The visual servoing problem comes up in robotic tasks that range from target following for an aerial vehicle to robotic manipulation to spacecraft docking. Standard visual servoing approaches typically rely on manually designed features and analytical dynamics models, which limits their generalization capability and often requires extensive feature and model engineering. In this work, we study how learned visual features, learned predictive dynamics models, and reinforcement learning can be combined to learn visual servoing mechanisms. We focus on target following, with the goal of designing algorithms that can learn a visual servo using low amounts of data of the target in question, so as to be easy and quick to adapt to new targets. Our approach is based on servoing the camera in the space of learned visual features, rather than image pixels or manually-designed keypoints. We demonstrate that standard deep features, in our case taken from a model trained for object classification, can be used together with a bilinear predictive model to learn an effective visual servo that is robust to visual variation, changes in viewing angle and appearance, and occlusions. A key component of our approach is to use reinforcement learning to learn which features are best suited for the task at hand. We show that our method can learn an effective visual servo using just tens of trajectories. We evaluate our method on a complex synthetic car following benchmark, and demonstrate substantial improvement over a conventional pixel-based approach.","pdf":"/pdf/55ed8968dae9d63d0170d30b045786e115302a60.pdf","TL;DR":"We use deep semantic features, learned predictive dynamics, and reinforcement learning to efficiently learn a visual servoing policy that is robust to visual variations.","conflicts":["berkeley.edu","google.com","openai.com"],"authors":["Alex X.

By offloading the computational burden of CPU and saving the need for transferring raw data in its entirety, NDP exhibits a great potential for acceleration and power reduction. Despite this potential, specific research activities on NDP have witnessed only limited success until recently, often owing to performance mismatches between logic and memory process technologies that put a limit on the processing capability of memory. Recently, there have been two major changes in the game, igniting the resurgence of NDP with renewed interest. The first is the success of machine learning (ML), which often demands a great deal of computation for training, requiring frequent transfers of big data. The second is the advent of NAND flash-based solid-state drives (SSDs) containing multicore processors that can accommodate extra computation for data processing. Sparked by these application needs and technological support, we evaluate the potential of NDP for ML using a new SSD platform that allows us to simulate in-storage processing (ISP) of ML workloads. Our platform (named ISP-ML) is a full-fledged simulator of a realistic multi-channel SSD that can execute various ML algorithms using the data stored in the SSD. For thorough performance analysis and in-depth comparison with alternatives, we focus on a specific algorithm: stochastic gradient decent (SGD), which is the de facto standard for training differentiable learning machines including deep neural networks. We implement and compare three variants of SGD (synchronous, Downpour, and elastic averaging) using ISP-ML, exploiting the multiple NAND channels for parallelizing SGD. In addition, we compare the performance of ISP and that of conventional in-host processing, revealing the advantages of ISP. Based on the advantages and limitations identified through our experiments, we further discuss directions for future research on ISP for accelerating ML.","pdf":"/pdf/f8b0436ea7370779edd703b7d7d35a9e34752fa9.pdf","keywords":[],"conflicts":["snu.ac.kr","yonsei.ac.kr"],"authors":["Hyeokjun Choe","Seil Lee","Hyunha Nam","Seongsik Park","Seijoon Kim","Eui-Young Chung","Sungroh Yoon"],"authorids":["genesis1104@snu.ac.kr","lees231@dsl.snu.ac.kr","godqhr825@snu.ac.kr","pss015@snu.ac.kr","hokiespa@snu.ac.kr","eychung@yonsei.ac.kr","sryoon@snu.ac.kr"]},"writers":[],"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":11,"writable":false},{"tddate":null,"replyto":null,"tcdate":1478379139467,"number":601,"tmdate":1485241277899,"id":"B1oK8aoxe","invitation":"ICLR.cc/2017/conference/-/submission","forum":"B1oK8aoxe","signatures":["~Carlos_Florensa1"],"readers":["everyone"],"content":{"title":"Stochastic Neural Networks for Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning","abstract":"Deep reinforcement learning has achieved many impressive results in recent years. However, many of the deep RL algorithms still employ naive exploration strategies, and they have been shown to perform poorly in tasks with sparse rewards, and/or with long horizons. To tackle these challenges, there are two common approaches. The first approach is to design a hierarchy over the actions, which would require domain-specific knowledge and careful hand-engineering. A different line of work utilizes domain-agnostic intrinsic rewards to guide exploration, which has been shown to be effective in tasks with sparse rewards. However, it is unclear how the knowledge of solving a task can be utilized for other tasks, leading to a high sample complexity overall for the entire collection of tasks. In this paper, we propose a general framework for learning useful skills in a pre-training environment, which can then be utilized in downstream tasks by training a high-level policy over these skills. To learn these skills, we use stochastic neural networks (SNNs) combined with an intrinsic reward, the design of which requires very minimal domain knowledge about the downstream tasks. Our experiments show that this combination is effective in learning a wide span of interpretable skills in a sample-efficient way, and, when trained on downstream tasks, can significantly boost the learning performance uniformly across all these tasks.

As an application, we implement recursion in the Neural Programmer-Interpreter framework on four tasks: grade-school addition, bubble sort, topological sort, and quicksort. We demonstrate superior generalizability and interpretability with small amounts of training data. Recursion divides the problem into smaller pieces and drastically reduces the domain of each neural network component, making it tractable to prove guarantees about the overall system’s behavior.

Although SGD scales well in terms of both the size of dataset and the number of parameters of the model, it has rapidly diminishing returns as parallel computing resources increase.  Second-order optimization methods have an affinity for well-estimated gradients and large mini-batches, and can therefore benefit much more from parallel computation in principle.   Unfortunately,  they often employ severe approximations to the curvature matrix in order to scale to large models with millions of parameters, limiting their effectiveness in practice versus well-tuned SGD with momentum.  The recently proposed K-FAC method(Martens and Grosse, 2015) uses a stronger and more sophisticated curvature approximation, and has been shown to make much more per-iteration progress than SGD, while only introducing a modest overhead.  In this paper, we develop a version of K-FAC that distributes the computation of gradients and additional quantities required by K-FAC across multiple machines, thereby taking advantage of method’s superior scaling to large mini-batches and mitigating its additional overheads. We provide a Tensorflow implementation of our approach which is easy to use and can be applied to many existing codebases without modification.  Additionally, we develop several algorithmic enhancements to K-FAC which can improve its computational performance for very large models.

Recent efforts towards reducing these overheads involve pruning and compressing the weights of various layers without hurting the accuracy. However, using weights pruning to generate sparse CNNs mostly reduces parameters from the fully connected layers and may not significantly reduce the computation costs with irregular sparsity. We present an acceleration method for CNNs, where we prune filters from CNNs that are identified as having a small effect on the output accuracy.  By removing whole filters in the network, together with their connecting feature maps, the computational costs are reduced significantly. In contrast to weights pruning, this approach does not result in sparse connectivity patterns.

Further, for species not in the ImageNet categories that are visually similar to some category, the cosine similarity of their activation vectors in the same layer should be high. By applying the inner product similarity of the activation vectors at the last fully connected layer for different species, we can roughly build their tree of life.

Experimental results have shown that the proposed HORNNs yield the state-of-the-art performance on both data sets, significantly outperforming the regular RNNs as well as the popular LSTMs. ","pdf":"/pdf/89361226043c5f96e3829a67adb15855122e7d4a.pdf","TL;DR":"we study novel neural network structures to better model long term dependency in sequential data","conflicts":["cse.yorku.ca"],"authors":["Rohollah Soltani","Hui Jiang"],"keywords":["Deep learning","Natural language processing"],"authorids":["rsoltani@cse.yorku.ca","hj@cse.yorku.ca"]},"writers":[],"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":10,"writable":false},{"tddate":null,"replyto":null,"tcdate":1478369130727,"number":567,"tmdate":1478369130727,"id":"ry7O1ssex","invitation":"ICLR.cc/2017/conference/-/submission","forum":"ry7O1ssex","signatures":["~Shuangfei_Zhai1"],"readers":["everyone"],"content":{"TL;DR":"","title":"Generative Adversarial Networks as Variational Training of Energy Based Models","abstract":"In this paper, we study deep generative models for effective unsupervised learning.

The training of VGAN takes a two step procedure: given $p(\\mathbf{x})$, $q(\\mathbf{x})$ is updated to maximize the lower bound; $p(\\mathbf{x})$ is then updated one step with samples drawn from $q(\\mathbf{x})$ to decrease the lower bound. VGAN is inspired by the generative adversarial networks (GANs), where $p(\\mathbf{x})$ corresponds to the discriminator and $q(\\mathbf{x})$ corresponds to the generator, but with several notable differences. We hence name our model variational GANs (VGANs). VGAN provides a practical solution to training deep EBMs in high dimensional space, by eliminating the need of MCMC sampling. From this view, we are also able to identify causes to the difficulty of training GANs and propose viable solutions.","pdf":"/pdf/dd97f6c4ef644bca2ec96f6e3eafa0bd8151a839.pdf","conflicts":["binghamton.edu"],"keywords":[],"authors":["Shuangfei Zhai","Yu Cheng","Rogerio Feris","Zhongfei Zhang"],"authorids":["szhai2@binghamton.edu","chengyu@us.ibm.com","rsferis@us.ibm.com","zhongfei@cs.binghamton.edu"]},"writers":[],"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":17,"writable":false},{"tddate":null,"replyto":null,"tcdate":1478367352506,"number":566,"tmdate":1484551298201,"id":"B1gtu5ilg","invitation":"ICLR.cc/2017/conference/-/submission","forum":"B1gtu5ilg","signatures":["~Xingyu_Lin1"],"readers":["everyone"],"content":{"title":"Transfer of View-manifold Learning to Similarity Perception of Novel Objects","abstract":"We develop a model of perceptual similarity judgment based on re-training a deep convolution neural network (DCNN) that learns to associate different views of each 3D object to capture the notion of object persistence and continuity in our visual experience. The re-training process effectively performs distance metric learning under the object persistency constraints, to modify the view-manifold of object representations. It reduces the effective distance between the representations of different views of the same object without compromising the distance between those of the views of different objects, resulting in the untangling of the view-manifolds between individual objects within the same category and across categories. This untangling enables the model to discriminate and recognize objects within the same category, independent of viewpoints. We found that this ability is not limited to the trained objects, but transfers to novel objects in both trained and untrained categories, as well as to a variety of completely novel artificial synthetic objects. This transfer in learning suggests the modification of distance metrics in view- manifolds is more general and abstract, likely at the levels of parts, and independent of the specific objects or categories experienced during training. Interestingly, the resulting transformation of feature representation in the deep networks is found to significantly better match human perceptual similarity judgment than AlexNet, suggesting that object persistence could be an important constraint in the development of perceptual similarity judgment in biological neural networks.\n","pdf":"/pdf/a98c1c424f75268406f8965243e4535a6a12d45a.pdf","TL;DR":"DCNN trained with multiple views of the same object can develop human-like perpetual similarity judgment that can transfer to novel objects","conflicts":["cmu.edu","pku.edu.cn","jhu.edu"],"authors":["Xingyu Lin","Hao Wang","Zhihao Li","Yimeng Zhang","Alan Yuille","Tai Sing Lee"],"keywords":["Deep learning","Transfer Learning"],"authorids":["sean.linxingyu@pku.edu.cn","hao.wang@pku.edu.cn","zhihaol@andrew.cmu.edu","yimengzh@andrew.cmu.edu","alan.yuille@jhu.edu","tai@cnbc.cmu.edu"]},"writers":[],"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":12,"writable":false},{"tddate":null,"replyto":null,"tcdate":1478365829347,"number":565,"tmdate":1484389343937,"id":"ryaFG5ige","invitation":"ICLR.cc/2017/conference/-/submission","forum":"ryaFG5ige","signatures":["~Mélanie_Ducoffe1"],"readers":["everyone"],"content":{"title":"Introducing Active Learning for CNN under the light of Variational Inference","abstract":"One main concern of the deep learning community is to increase the capacity of\nrepresentation of deep networks by increasing their depth.

The purpose is to capture features at both word level and sentence level. However, the character level information are usually ignored. In this paper, we take word morphology and word semantic meaning into consideration, which are represented by character-aware embedding and word distributed embedding. By concatenating both character-level and word distributed embedding together and arranging words in order, a sentence representation matrix could be obtained. To overcome data sparsity problem of short text, sentence representation vector is then derived based on different views from sentence representation matrix.

The current methods, however, have the following two problems: (1) They can not understand the ambiguous use of words in the questions as word usage can strongly depend on the context (e.g. the word “relationship” has quite different meanings in the categories of Love advice and other categories). As a result, the accuracies of their answer selections are not good enough. (2) The current methods can only select from among the answers held by QA sites and can not generate new ones. Thus, they can not answer the questions that are somewhat different with those stored in QA sites. Our solution, Neural Answer Construction Model, tackles these problems as it: (1) Incorporates the biases of semantics behind questions (e.g. categories assigned to questions) into word embeddings while also computing them regardless of the semantics. As a result, it can extract answers that suit the contexts of words used in the question as well as following the common usage of words across semantics. This improves the accuracy of answer selection. (2) Uses biLSTM to compute the embeddings of questions as well as those of the sentences often used to form answers (e.g. sentences representing conclusions or those supplementing the conclusions). It then simultaneously learns the optimum combination of those sentences as well as the closeness between the question and those sentences. As a result, our model can construct an answer that corresponds to the situation that underlies the question; it fills the gap between answer selection and generation and is the first model to move beyond the current simple answer selection model for non-factoid QAs. Evaluations using datasets created for love advice stored in the Japanese QA site, Oshiete goo, indicate that our model achieves 20 % higher accuracy in answer creation than the strong baselines.

Neural conversation models -- purely data-driven systems trained end-to-end on dialogue corpora -- have shown great promise recently, yet they often produce short and generic responses. This work presents new training and decoding methods that improve the quality, coherence, and diversity of long responses generated using sequence-to-sequence models. Our approach adds self-attention to the decoder to maintain coherence in longer responses, and we propose a practical approach, called the glimpse-model, for scaling to large datasets. We introduce a stochastic beam-search algorithm with segment-by-segment reranking which lets us inject diversity earlier in the generation process. We trained on a combined data set of over 2.3B conversation messages mined from the web. In human evaluation studies, our method produces longer responses overall, with a higher proportion rated as acceptable and excellent as length increases, compared to baseline sequence-to-sequence models with explicit length-promotion.

TreNet leverages convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to extract salient features from local raw data of time series. Meanwhile, considering long-range dependencies existing in the sequence of historical local trends, TreNet uses a long-short term memory recurrent neural network (LSTM) to capture such dependency.

We demonstrate our approach on a Twitter domain sentiment analysis task with sequential knowledge transfer from four related tasks.  We show that our technique outperforms networks fine-tuned to the target task. Additionally, we show both through empirical evidence and examples that it does not forget useful knowledge from the source task that is forgotten during standard fine-tuning.

However, the execution speed of these compressed models are still far below the real-time processing requirement of mobile services. To address this limitation, we propose a novel acceleration framework: DeepRebirth by exploring the deep learning model parameter sparsity through merging the parameter-free layers with their neighbor convolution layers to a single dense layer. The design of DeepRebirth is motivated by the key observation: some layers (i.e., normalization and pooling) in deep learning models actually consume a large portion of computational time even few learned parameters are involved, and acceleration of these layers has the potential to improve the processing speed significantly. Essentially, the functionality of several merged layers is replaced by the new dense layer – rebirth layer in DeepRebirth. In order to preserve the same functionality, the rebirth layer model parameters are re-trained to be functionality equivalent to the original several merged layers. The extensive experiments performed on ImageNet using several popular mobile devices demonstrate that DeepRebirth is not only providing huge speed-up in model deployment and significant memory saving but also maintaining the model accuracy, i.e., 3x-5x speed-up and energy saving on GoogLeNet with only 0.4% accuracy drop on top-5 categorization in ImageNet. Further, by combining with other model compression techniques, DeepRebirth offers an average of 65ms model forwarding time on each image using Samsung Galaxy S6 with only 2.4% accuracy drop. In addition, 2.5x run-time memory saving is achieved with rebirth layers.","pdf":"/pdf/3bca0d7ff08404194f79153f620f8e620475d1b4.pdf","keywords":[],"conflicts":["lehigh.edu","samsung.com"],"authors":["Dawei Li","Xiaolong Wang","Deguang Kong","Mooi Choo Chuah"],"authorids":["dal312@lehigh.edu","visionxiaolong@gmail.com","doogkong@gmail.com"]},"writers":[],"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":13,"writable":false},{"tddate":null,"replyto":null,"tcdate":1478299167950,"number":526,"tmdate":1484355484988,"id":"SJ_QCYqle","invitation":"ICLR.cc/2017/conference/-/submission","forum":"SJ_QCYqle","signatures":["~Evan_Racah1"],"readers":["everyone"],"content":{"title":"Semi-Supervised Detection of Extreme Weather Events in Large Climate Datasets","abstract":"The detection and identification of extreme weather events in large scale climate simulations is an important problem for risk management, informing governmental policy decisions and advancing our basic understanding of the climate system.\nRecent work has shown that fully supervised convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can yield acceptable accuracy for classifying well-known types of extreme weather events when large amounts of labeled data are available.

In many real-world tasks, designing a suitable reward function takes considerable manual engineering and often requires additional and potentially visible sensors to be installed just to measure whether the task has been executed successfully. Furthermore, many interesting tasks consist of multiple steps that must be executed in sequence. Even when the final outcome can be measured, it does not necessarily provide useful feedback on these implicit intermediate steps or sub-goals.\nTo address these issues, we propose leveraging the abstraction power of intermediate visual representations learned by deep models to quickly infer perceptual reward functions from small numbers of demonstrations. We present a method that is able to identify the key intermediate steps of a task from only a handful of demonstration sequences, and automatically identify the most discriminative features for identifying these steps. This method makes use of the features in a pre-trained deep model, but does not require any explicit sub-goal supervision. The resulting reward functions, which are dense and smooth, can then be used by an RL agent to learn to perform the task in real-world settings. To evaluate the learned reward functions, we present qualitative results on two real-world tasks and a quantitative evaluation against a human-designed reward function. We also demonstrate that our method can be used to learn a complex real-world door opening skill using a real robot, even when the demonstration used for reward learning is provided by a human using their own hand.

Human conversation, however, is notoriously incomplete, ambiguous, and full of extraneous detail. To operate effectively, the agent must not only understand what was explicitly conveyed but also be able to reason in the presence of missing or unclear information. When unable to resolve ambiguities on its own, the agent must be able to ask the user for the necessary clarifications and incorporate the response in its reasoning. Motivated by this problem we introduce QRAQ (\"crack\"; Query, Reason, and Answer Questions), a new synthetic domain, in which a User gives an Agent a short story and asks a challenge question. These problems are designed to test the reasoning and interaction capabilities of a learning-based Agent in a setting that requires multiple conversational turns. A good Agent should ask only non-deducible, relevant questions until it has enough information to correctly answer the User's question. We use standard and improved reinforcement learning based memory-network architectures to solve QRAQ problems in the difficult setting where the reward signal only tells the Agent if its final answer to the challenge question is correct or not. To provide an upper-bound to the RL results we also train the same architectures using supervised information that tells the Agent during training which variables to query and the answer to the challenge question. We evaluate our architectures on four QRAQ dataset types, and scale the complexity for each along multiple dimensions.","pdf":"/pdf/d0f5408fda8ab396f6244cd5d04dec64b811e366.pdf","TL;DR":"A new dataset QRAQ of ambiguous stories in which an Agent must learn to reason and interact with a User to obtain important missing information needed to answer a challenge question.","conflicts":["cs.umich.edu","ibm.com","cs.umass.edu"],"authors":["Xiaoxiao Guo","Tim Klinger","Clemens Rosenbaum","Joseph P.

We describe a predictive neural network (\"PredNet\") architecture that is inspired by the concept of \"predictive coding\" from the neuroscience literature. These networks learn to predict future frames in a video sequence, with each layer in the network making local predictions and only forwarding deviations from those predictions to subsequent network layers. We show that these networks are able to robustly learn to predict the movement of synthetic (rendered) objects, and that in doing so, the networks learn  internal representations that are useful for decoding latent object parameters (e.g. pose) that support object recognition with fewer training views. We also show that these networks can scale to complex natural image streams (car-mounted camera videos), capturing key aspects of both egocentric movement and the movement of objects in the visual scene. Furthermore, the representation learned in this setting is useful for estimating the steering angle. These results suggest that prediction represents a powerful framework for unsupervised learning, allowing for implicit learning of object and scene structure.","pdf":"/pdf/4787a221748ace76fa3a67876375f3856aa192b6.pdf","conflicts":["harvard.edu"],"keywords":[],"authors":["William Lotter","Gabriel Kreiman","David Cox"],"authorids":["lotter@fas.harvard.edu","gabriel.kreiman@tch.harvard.edu","davidcox@fas.harvard.edu"]},"writers":[],"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":13,"writable":false},{"tddate":null,"replyto":null,"tcdate":1478297550666,"number":507,"tmdate":1483503512792,"id":"r1PRvK9el","invitation":"ICLR.cc/2017/conference/-/submission","forum":"r1PRvK9el","signatures":["~yelong_shen1"],"readers":["everyone"],"content":{"TL;DR":"","title":"Implicit ReasoNet: Modeling Large-Scale Structured Relationships with Shared Memory","abstract":"Recent studies on knowledge base completion, the task of recovering missing relationships based on recorded relations, demonstrate the importance of learning embeddings from multi-step relations.

We focus here on tasks in which the input is a description of the genetic variation specific to a patient, the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), yielding millions of ternary inputs. Improving the ability of deep learning to handle such datasets could have an important impact in medical research, more specifically in precision medicine, where high-dimensional data regarding a particular patient is used to make predictions of interest. Even though the amount of data for such tasks is increasing, this mismatch between the number of examples and the number of inputs remains a concern. Naive implementations of classifier neural networks involve a huge number of free parameters in their first layer (number of input features times number of hidden units): each input feature is associated with as many parameters as there are hidden units. We propose a novel neural network parametrization which considerably reduces the number of free parameters. It is based on the idea that we can first learn or provide a distributed representation for each input feature (e.g. for each position in the genome where variations are observed in data), and then learn (with another neural network called the parameter prediction network) how to map a feature's distributed representation (based on the feature's identity not its value) to the vector of parameters specific to that feature in the classifier neural network (the weights which link the value of the feature to each of the hidden units). This approach views the problem of producing the parameters associated with each feature as a multi-task learning problem. We show experimentally on a population stratification task of interest to medical studies that the proposed approach can significantly reduce both the number of parameters and the error rate of the classifier.","pdf":"/pdf/0adc83ab3eb6b160530a87b62382a862e33a42e3.pdf","TL;DR":"Drastically reducing the number of parameters, when the number of input features is orders of magnitude larger than the number of training examples, such as in genomics.","conflicts":["umontreal.ca","cvc.uab.es","ub.edu","well.ox.ca.uk","icm.rc.org","mhi-rc.org"],"authors":["Adriana Romero","Pierre Luc Carrier","Akram Erraqabi","Tristan Sylvain","Alex Auvolat","Etienne Dejoie","Marc-André Legault","Marie-Pierre Dubé","Julie G.

Towards this goal, we demonstrate an extension of a variational autoencoder that can learn a method for computing representations, or statistics, of datasets in an unsupervised fashion. The network is trained to produce statistics that encapsulate a generative model for each dataset.

However, real-world applications of such methods require generalizing to the vast variability of the real world. Deep networks are known to achieve remarkable generalization when provided with massive amounts of labeled data, but can we provide this breadth of experience to an RL agent, such as a robot? The robot might continuously learn as it explores the world around it, even while it is deployed and performing useful tasks. However, this learning requires access to a reward function, to tell the agent whether it is succeeding or failing at its task. Such reward functions are often hard to measure in the real world, especially in domains such as robotics and dialog systems, where the reward could depend on the unknown positions of objects or the emotional state of the user. On the other hand, it is often quite practical to provide the agent with reward functions in a limited set of situations, such as when a human supervisor is present, or in a controlled laboratory setting. Can we make use of this limited supervision, and still benefit from the breadth of experience an agent might collect in the unstructured real world? In this paper, we formalize this problem setting as semi-supervised reinforcement learning (SSRL), where the reward function can only be evaluated in a set of “labeled” MDPs, and the agent must generalize its behavior to the wide range of states it might encounter in a set of “unlabeled” MDPs, by using experience from both settings. Our proposed method infers the task objective in the unlabeled MDPs through an algorithm that resembles inverse RL, using the agent’s own prior experience in the labeled MDPs as a kind of demonstration of optimal behavior. We evaluate our method on challenging, continuous control tasks that require control directly from images, and show that our approach can improve the generalization of a learned deep neural network policy by using experience for which no reward function is available.

An adversarial sample is often generated by adding adversarial perturbation (AP) to a normal test sample. Recent studies that tried to analyze classifiers under such AP are mostly empirical and provide little understanding of why. To fill this gap, we propose a theoretical framework for analyzing learning-based classifiers, especially deep neural networks (DNN) in the face of such AP. By using concepts from topology, this framework brings forth the key reasons why an adversarial can fool a  classifier ($f_1$) and suggests a new focus on its oracle ($f_2$, like human annotators of that specific task). By investigating the topology relationship between two (pseudo)metric spaces corresponding to predictor $f_1$ and oracle $f_2$, we develop several ideal conditions that can determine if $f_1$ is always robust (strong-robust) against adversarial samples according to its $f_2$. The theoretical framework leads to a set of novel and complementary insights that have not been uncovered by the literature. Surprisingly our theorems find that just one extra irrelevant feature can make a classifier not strong-robust, and the right feature representation learning is the key to getting a classifier that is both accurate and strong robust. Empirically we find that \"Siamese architecture\" can be used to help DNN models get close to the desired topological relationship for strong-robustness, which in turn effectively improves its performance against AP.

General consensus in this field dictates that the argument components form a hierarchy of persuasion, which manifests itself in a tree structure. This work provides the first neural network-based approach to argumentation mining, focusing on extracting links between argument components, with a secondary focus on classifying types of argument components. In order to solve this problem, we propose to use a modification of a Pointer Network architecture. A Pointer Network is appealing for this task for the following reasons: 1) It takes into account the sequential nature of argument components; 2) By construction, it enforces certain properties of the tree structure present in argument relations; 3) The hidden representations can be applied to auxiliary tasks. In order to extend the contribution of the original Pointer Network model, we construct a joint model that simultaneously attempts to learn the type of argument component, as well as continuing to predict links between argument components. The proposed model achieves state-of-the-art results on two separate evaluation corpora.

While these types of models have produced impressive results, they are not able to model the higher-order interactions involved in problems such as video description/captioning, where the relationship between parts of the video and the concepts being depicted is complex. Motivated by these observations, we propose a novel memory-based attention model for video description. Our model utilizes memories of past attention when reasoning about where to attend to in the current time step, similar to the central executive system proposed in human cognition. This allows the model to not only reason about local attention more effectively, it allows it to consider the entire sequence of video frames while generating each word.

A critical issue for training such large networks on large-scale datasets is to prevent overfitting while at the same time providing enough model capacity. We propose DSD, a dense-sparse-dense training flow, for regularizing deep neural networks. In the first D (Dense) step, we train a dense network to learn connection weights and importance. In the S (Sparse) step, we regularize the network by pruning the unimportant connections with small weights and retraining the network given the sparsity constraint. In the final D (re-Dense) step, we increase the model capacity by removing the sparsity constraint, re-initialize the pruned parameters from zero, and retrain the whole dense network. Experiments show that DSD training can improve the performance for a wide range of CNNs, RNNs and LSTMs on the tasks of image classification, caption generation and speech recognition. On ImageNet, DSD improved the Top1 accuracy of GoogLeNet by 1.1%, VGG-16 by 4.3%, ResNet-18 by 1.1% and ResNet-50 by 0.9%.

However, given that in practice training data is scarce for all but a small set of problems, a core question is how to incorporate prior knowledge into a model. Here we consider the case of prior procedural knowledge, such as knowing the overall recursive structure of a sequence transduction program or the fact that a program will likely use arithmetic operations on real numbers to solve a task. To this end we present a differentiable interpreter for the programming language Forth. Through a neural implementation of the dual stack machine that underlies Forth, programmers can write program sketches with slots that can be filled with behaviour trained from program input-output data. As the program interpreter is end-to-end differentiable, we can optimize this behaviour directly through gradient descent techniques on user specified objectives, and also integrate the program into any larger neural computation graph. We show empirically that our interpreter is able to effectively leverage different levels of prior program structure and learn complex transduction tasks such as sequence sorting or addition with substantially less data and better generalisation over problem sizes. In addition, we introduce neural program optimisations based on symbolic computation and parallel branching that lead to significant speed improvements.

In this method, a pair of dual networks, one for encoding items and the other for users, are jointly trained in a collaborative fashion. \nParticularly, both networks produce embeddings at multiple aligned levels, which, when combined together, can accurately predict the matching between items and users.

In this paper, we consider RL tasks defined as a sequence of high-level instructions described by natural language and study two types of generalization: to unseen and longer sequences of previously seen instructions, and to sequences where the instructions themselves were previously not seen. \nWe present a novel hierarchical deep RL architecture that consists of two interacting neural controllers: a meta controller that reads instructions and repeatedly communicates subtasks to a subtask controller that in turn learns to perform such subtasks. To generalize better to unseen instructions, we propose a regularizer that encourages to learn subtask embeddings that capture correspondences between similar subtasks. We also propose a new differentiable neural network architecture in the meta controller that learns temporal abstractions which makes learning more stable under delayed reward. Our architecture is evaluated on a stochastic 2D grid world and a 3D visual environment where the agent should execute a list of instructions. We demonstrate that the proposed architecture is able to generalize well over unseen instructions as well as longer lists of instructions.","pdf":"/pdf/7aa7c748b79767b8cdb7f938726e1d39fa0a5ad7.pdf","conflicts":["umich.edu","microsoft.com"],"authors":["Junhyuk Oh","Satinder Singh","Honglak Lee","Pushmeet Kohli"],"keywords":["Reinforcement Learning","Deep learning"],"authorids":["junhyuk@umich.edu","baveja@umich.edu","honglak@umich.edu","pkohli@microsoft.com"]},"writers":[],"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":15,"writable":false},{"ddate":null,"cdate":null,"tddate":null,"replyto":null,"tcdate":1478290027892,"number":415,"tmdate":1484243230115,"id":"Hk4_qw5xe","invitation":"ICLR.cc/2017/conference/-/submission","forum":"Hk4_qw5xe","signatures":["~Martin_Arjovsky1"],"readers":["everyone"],"content":{"title":"Towards Principled Methods for Training Generative Adversarial Networks","abstract":"The goal of this paper is not to introduce a single algorithm or method, but to make theoretical steps towards fully understanding the training dynamics of gen- erative adversarial networks.

Rather than learning a single, fixed policy for solving all instances of a task, we introduce a metacontroller which learns to optimize a sequence of \"imagined\" internal simulations over predictive models of the world in order to construct a more informed, and more economical, solution. The metacontroller component is a model-free reinforcement learning agent, which decides both how many iterations of the optimization procedure to run, as well as which model to consult on each iteration. The models (which we call \"experts\") can be state transition models, action-value functions, or any other mechanism that provides information useful for solving the task, and can be learned on-policy or off-policy in parallel with the metacontroller. When the metacontroller, controller, and experts were trained with \"interaction networks\" (Battaglia et al., 2016) as expert models, our approach was able to solve a challenging decision-making problem under complex non-linear dynamics. The metacontroller learned to adapt the amount of computation it performed to the difficulty of the task, and learned how to choose which experts to consult by factoring in both their reliability and individual computational resource costs. This allowed the metacontroller to achieve a lower overall cost (task loss plus computational cost) than more traditional fixed policy approaches.

Inferring likely structures from few examples is a complex task often requiring the formulation of priors and sophisticated inference procedures. In the setting of Gaussian Graphical Models (GGMs) a popular estimator is a maximum likelihood objective with a penalization on the precision matrix. Adapting this estimator to capture domain-specific knowledge as priors or a new data likelihood requires great effort. In addition, structure recovery is an indirect consequence of the data-fit term. By contrast, it may be easier to generate training samples of data that arise from graphs with the desired structure properties. We propose here to leverage this latter source of information as training data to learn a function mapping from empirical covariance matrices to estimated graph structures.  Learning this function brings two benefits: it implicitly models the desired structure or sparsity properties to form suitable priors, and it can be tailored to the specific problem of edge structure discovery, rather than maximizing data likelihood. We apply this framework to several real-world problems in structure discovery and show that it can be competitive to standard approaches such as graphical lasso, at a fraction of the execution speed. We use convolutional neural networks to parametrize our estimators due to the compositional structure of the problem. Experimentally, our learnable graph-discovery method trained on synthetic data generalizes well to different data: identifying relevant edges in real data, completely unknown at training time. We find that on genetics, brain imaging, and simulation data we obtain competitive(and generally superior) performance, compared with analytical methods.

A recent line of work uses bilingual (two languages) corpora to learn a different vector for each sense of a word, by exploiting crosslingual signals to aid sense identification. We present a multi-view Bayesian non-parametric algorithm which improves multi-sense word embeddings by (a) using multilingual (i.e., more than two languages) corpora to significantly improve sense embeddings beyond what one achieves with bilingual information, and (b) uses a principled approach to learn a variable number of senses per word, in a data-driven manner.

We propose a novel online dictionary-learning (sparse-coding) framework which incorporates the addition and deletion of hidden units (dictionary elements), and is inspired by the adult neurogenesis phenomenon in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus, known to be associated with improved cognitive function and adaptation to new environments. In the online learning setting, where new input instances arrive sequentially in batches, the “neuronal birth” is implemented by adding new units with random initial weights (random dictionary elements); the number of new units is determined by the current performance (representation error) of the dictionary, higher error causing an increase in the birth rate. “Neuronal death” is implemented by imposing l1/l2-regularization (group sparsity) on the dictionary within the block-coordinate descent optimization at each iteration of our online alternating minimization scheme, which iterates between the code and dictionary updates. Finally, hidden unit connectivity adaptation is facilitated by introducing sparsity in dictionary elements. Our empirical evaluation on several real-life datasets (images and language) as well as on synthetic data demonstrates that the proposed approach can considerably outperform the state-of-art fixed-size (nonadaptive) online sparse coding of Mairal et al.

Equally ubiquitous is the usage of beam search (BS) as an approximate inference algorithm to decode output sequences from these models.

Producing lists of nearly identical sequences is not only computationally wasteful but also typically fails to capture the inherent ambiguity of complex AI tasks. To overcome this problem, we propose Diverse Beam Search (DBS), an alternative to BS that decodes a list of diverse outputs by optimizing a diversity-augmented objective.

We also show that our model can be used to improve exploration in complex maze environments.","pdf":"/pdf/03ec9c3351184cd73f1e6850182ccf86b2514638.pdf","conflicts":["google.com"],"authors":["Silvia Chiappa","Sébastien Racaniere","Daan Wierstra","Shakir Mohamed"],"keywords":["Deep learning","Applications","Unsupervised Learning"],"authorids":["csilvia@google.com","sracaniere@google.com","wierstra@google.com","shakir@google.com"]},"writers":[],"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":15,"writable":false},{"tddate":null,"replyto":null,"tcdate":1478287469110,"number":353,"tmdate":1478287469110,"id":"HkSOlP9lg","invitation":"ICLR.cc/2017/conference/-/submission","forum":"HkSOlP9lg","signatures":["~Patrick_Putzky1"],"readers":["everyone"],"content":{"TL;DR":"","title":"Recurrent Inference Machines for Solving Inverse Problems","abstract":"Inverse problems are typically solved by first defining a model and then choosing an inference procedure. With this separation of modeling from inference, inverse problems can be framed in a modular way. For example, variational inference can be applied to a broad class of models. The modularity, however, typically goes away after model parameters have been trained under a chosen inference procedure. During training, model and inference often interact in a way that the model parameters will ultimately be adapted to the chosen inference procedure, posing the two components inseparable after training. But if model and inference become inseperable after training, why separate them in the first place?\n\nWe propose a novel learning framework which abandons the dichotomy between model and inference. Instead, we introduce Recurrent Inference Machines (RIM), a class of recurrent neural networks (RNN) that directly learn to solve inverse problems.\n\nWe demonstrate the effectiveness of RIMs in experiments on various image reconstruction tasks. We show empirically that RIMs exhibit the desirable convergence behavior of classical inference procedures, and that they can outperform state-of- the-art methods when trained on specialized inference tasks.\n\nOur approach bridges the gap between inverse problems and deep learning, providing a framework for fast progression in the field of inverse problems.","pdf":"/pdf/1a94a67472aff744865bead1de0cf01ff3805ded.pdf","conflicts":["uva.nl","ceasar.de","uci.edu"],"authors":["Patrick Putzky","Max Welling"],"keywords":["Optimization","Deep learning","Computer vision"],"authorids":["patrick.putzky@gmail.com","welling.max@gmail.com"]},"writers":[],"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":12,"writable":false},{"tddate":null,"replyto":null,"tcdate":1478287448570,"number":352,"tmdate":1482519758670,"id":"SyWvgP5el","invitation":"ICLR.cc/2017/conference/-/submission","forum":"SyWvgP5el","signatures":["~Aravind_Rajeswaran1"],"readers":["everyone"],"content":{"title":"EPOpt: Learning Robust Neural Network Policies Using Model Ensembles","abstract":"Sample complexity and safety are major challenges when learning policies with reinforcement learning for real-world tasks, especially when the policies are represented using rich function approximators like deep neural networks.

The sparsity structure of the network is identified using the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM), which is widely used in large optimization problems. This method alternates between promoting the sparsity of the network and optimizing the recognition performance, which allows us to exploit the two-part structure of the corresponding objective functions.

The tightness of the variational bound relies on gradually increasing temperature as we walk away from the data, at each step providing a gradient on the parameters to maximize the probability that the transition operator returns to its previous state. Interestingly, this algorithm admits a variant where there is no explicit energy function, i.e., the parameters are used to directly define the transition operator.

However, the most prevalent regularizations do not leverage all the capacity of the models since they rely on reducing the effective number of parameters. Feature decorrelation is an alternative for using the full capacity of the models but the overfitting reduction margins are too narrow given the overhead it introduces. In this paper, we show that regularizing negatively correlated features is an obstacle for effective decorrelation and present OrthoReg, a novel regularization technique that locally enforces feature orthogonality. As a result, imposing locality constraints in feature decorrelation removes interferences between negatively correlated feature weights, allowing the regularizer to reach higher decorrelation bounds, and reducing the overfitting more effectively. \nIn particular, we show that the models regularized with OrthoReg have higher accuracy bounds even when batch normalization and dropout present. Moreover, since our regularization is directly performed on the weights, it is especially suitable for fully convolutional neural networks, where the weight space is constant compared to the feature map space. As a result, we are able to reduce the overfitting of state-of-the-art CNNs on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and SVHN.","pdf":"/pdf/f19bbcaa09e109658ab2dd5cd039fbe2b4eeb076.pdf","TL;DR":"We show that that models regularized with local feature decorrelation have lower overfitting.","conflicts":["cvc.uab.es","uab.es","uab.cat","cvc.uab.cat"],"authors":["Pau Rodríguez","Jordi Gonzàlez","Guillem Cucurull","Josep M.

Intuitively, these long-range dependencies are of semantic nature. In contrast, latent topic models are able to capture the global underlying semantic structure of a document but do not account for word ordering. The proposed TopicRNN model integrates the merits of RNNs and latent topic models: it captures local (syntactic) dependencies using an RNN and global (semantic) dependencies using latent topics. Unlike previous work on contextual RNN language modeling, our model is learned end-to-end. Empirical results on word prediction show that TopicRNN outperforms existing contextual RNN baselines. In addition, TopicRNN can be used as an unsupervised feature extractor for documents. We do this for sentiment analysis on the IMDB movie review dataset and report an error rate of 6.28%.

In this paper, we propose a key-value attention mechanism that produces separate representations for the key and value of a memory, and for a representation that encodes the next-word distribution. This usage of past memories outperforms existing memory-augmented neural language models on two corpora. Yet, we found that it mainly utilizes past memory only of the previous five representations.

However, these models typically assume that modalities are forced to have a conditioned relation, i.e., we can only generate modalities in one direction. To achieve our objective, we should extract a joint representation that captures high-level concepts among all modalities and through which we can exchange them bi-directionally. As described herein, we propose a joint multimodal variational autoencoder (JMVAE), in which all modalities are independently conditioned on joint representation. In other words, it models a joint distribution of modalities. Furthermore, to be able to generate missing modalities from the remaining modalities properly, we develop an additional method, JMVAE-kl, that is trained by reducing the divergence between JMVAE's encoder and prepared networks of respective modalities. Our experiments show that our proposed method can obtain appropriate joint representation from multiple modalities and that it can generate and reconstruct them more properly than conventional VAEs.

This is motivated by making a connection between the fixed points of the regularized policy gradient algorithm and the Q-values. This connection allows us to estimate the Q-values from the action preferences of the policy, to which we apply Q-learning updates. We refer to the new technique as ‘PGQ’, for policy gradient and Q-learning.

The compression space is homological because all layers fetch hashed values from it. The reconstruction network is plugged into the whole network and trained jointly. On several benchmark datasets, HFH demonstrates high compression ratios with little loss on prediction accuracy. Particularly, HFH includes the recently proposed HashedNets as a degenerated scenario and shows significantly improved performance.

A lot, it turns out. Neural network model compression has become a topic of great interest in recent years, and many different techniques have been proposed to address this problem. In general, this is motivated by the idea that smaller models typically lead to better generalization. At the same time, the decision of what to prune and when to prune necessarily forces us to confront our assumptions about how neural networks actually learn to represent patterns in data. In this work we set out to test several long-held hypotheses about neural network learning representations and numerical approaches to pruning. To accomplish this we first reviewed the historical literature and derived a novel algorithm to prune whole neurons (as opposed to the traditional method of pruning weights) from optimally trained networks using a second-order Taylor method. We then set about testing the performance of our algorithm and analyzing the quality of the decisions it made. As a baseline for comparison we used a first-order Taylor method based on the Skeletonization algorithm and an exhaustive brute-force serial pruning algorithm. Our proposed algorithm worked well compared to a first-order method, but not nearly as well as the brute-force method. Our error analysis led us to question the validity of many widely-held assumptions behind pruning algorithms in general and the trade-offs we often make in the interest of reducing computational complexity. We discovered that there is a straightforward way, however expensive, to serially prune 40-70\\% of the neurons in a trained network with minimal effect on the learning representation and without any re-training.

However, existing work on models trained end-to-end perform only word classification, rather than sentence-level sequence prediction. Studies have shown that human lipreading performance increases for longer words (Easton & Basala, 1982), indicating the importance of features capturing temporal context in an ambiguous communication channel. Motivated by this observation, we present LipNet, a model that maps a variable-length sequence of video frames to text, making use of spatiotemporal convolutions, a recurrent network, and the connectionist temporal classification loss, trained entirely end-to-end. To the best of our knowledge, LipNet is the first end-to-end sentence-level lipreading model that simultaneously learns spatiotemporal visual features and a sequence model.

Rather than designing a “fast” reinforcement learning algorithm, we propose to represent it as a recurrent neural network (RNN) and learn it from data. In our proposed method, RL^2, the algorithm is encoded in the weights of the RNN, which are learned slowly through a general-purpose (“slow”) RL algorithm. The RNN receives all information a typical RL algorithm would receive, including observations, actions, rewards, and termination flags; and it retains its state across episodes in a given Markov Decision Process (MDP). The activations of the RNN store the state of the “fast” RL algorithm on the current (previously unseen) MDP. We evaluate RL^2 experimentally on both small-scale and large-scale problems. On the small-scale side, we train it to solve randomly generated multi-arm bandit problems and finite MDPs. After RL^2 is trained, its performance on new MDPs is close to human-designed algorithms with optimality guarantees.

We show the existence of depth scales that naturally limit the maximum depth of signal propagation through these random networks. Our main practical result is to show that random networks may be trained precisely when information can travel through them. Thus, the depth scales that we identify provide bounds on how deep a network may be trained for a specific choice of hyperparameters. As a corollary to this, we argue that in networks at the edge of chaos, one of these depth scales diverges. Thus arbitrarily deep networks may be trained only sufficiently close to criticality. We show that the presence of dropout destroys the order-to-chaos critical point and therefore strongly limits the maximum trainable depth for random networks. Finally, we develop a mean field theory for backpropagation and we show that the ordered and chaotic phases correspond to regions of vanishing and exploding gradient respectively.","pdf":"/pdf/9a8f0c6b5183cc6558eb4280f6e092c7ed309606.pdf","TL;DR":"We predict whether randomly initialized neural networks can be trained by studying whether or not information can travel through them.","keywords":["Theory","Deep learning"],"conflicts":["google.com","stanford.edu"],"authors":["Samuel S.

It can be a powerful tool for the preservation of ecological diversity. We investigate probabilistic models to analyse signals issued from real-world bioacoustic sound scenes. We study a Bayesian non-parametric sequential models based on Hierarchical Dirichlet Process Hidden Markov Models (HDP-HMM). The model is able to infer hidden states, that are referred here as song units. However, using such a model raise one main issue: defining the number of hidden states the model has to learn. In bioacoustic problems we often do not know the number of song units (unlike in human speech recognition). Hence, we work with the Hierarchical Dirichlet Process (HDP)-HMM, which is a Bayesian non-parametric (BNP) model that offers a way to tackle this challenging problem. We focus our work on unsupervised learning from bioacoustic data. It consists in simultaneously finding the structure of hidden song units and automatically infer the unknown number of the hidden states to represent the data. Two real bioacoustic sound scene applications are investigated in this work: on whale and multi-species birds segmentation. The learning of these models is proceeded by using Markov-Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling techniques on Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) of audio signals. The results show an interesting song unit segmentation of the bioacoustic signals and open new insights for unsupervised analysis of such signals. This paper illustrates the potential of chunking non-human animal signals into structured parts. This can yield to a new species representation and help experts to better understand the behaviour of such species as Kershenbaum et al.

Recent successes in deep reinforcement learning have been achieved mostly using simple heuristic exploration strategies such as $\\epsilon$-greedy action selection or Gaussian control noise, but there are many tasks where these methods are insufficient to make any learning progress. Here, we consider more complex heuristics: efficient and scalable exploration strategies that maximize a notion of an agent's surprise about its experiences via intrinsic motivation. We propose to learn a model of the MDP transition probabilities concurrently with the policy, and to form intrinsic rewards that approximate the KL-divergence of the true transition probabilities from the learned model. One of our approximations results in using surprisal as intrinsic motivation, while the other gives the $k$-step learning progress. We show that our incentives enable agents to succeed in a wide range of environments with high-dimensional state spaces and very sparse rewards, including continuous control tasks and games in the Atari RAM domain, outperforming several other heuristic exploration techniques. \n","pdf":"/pdf/5279b8d42388c4de00cddea9345b1a0a3af617af.pdf","TL;DR":"Learn a dynamics model and use it to make your agent boldly go where it has not gone before.","conflicts":["berkeley.edu"],"keywords":["Reinforcement Learning"],"authors":["Joshua Achiam","Shankar Sastry"],"authorids":["jachiam@berkeley.edu","sastry@coe.berkeley.edu"]},"writers":[],"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":10,"writable":false},{"tddate":null,"replyto":null,"tcdate":1478273020660,"number":194,"tmdate":1484223117523,"id":"SkB-_mcel","invitation":"ICLR.cc/2017/conference/-/submission","forum":"SkB-_mcel","signatures":["~Werner_Zellinger1"],"readers":["everyone"],"content":{"title":"Central Moment Discrepancy (CMD) for Domain-Invariant Representation Learning","abstract":"The learning of domain-invariant representations in the context of domain adaptation with neural networks is considered.

Although some standard distribution matching approaches exist that can be interpreted as the matching of weighted sums of moments, e.g. Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD), an explicit order-wise matching of higher order moments has not been considered before.\nWe propose to match the higher order central moments of probability distributions by means of order-wise moment differences. Our model does not require computationally expensive distance and kernel matrix computations. We utilize the equivalent representation of probability distributions by moment sequences to define a new distance function, called Central Moment Discrepancy (CMD).

We further prove that convergence of probability distributions on compact intervals w.r.t. the new metric implies convergence in distribution of the respective random variables.\nWe test our approach on two different benchmark data sets for object recognition (Office) and sentiment analysis of product reviews (Amazon reviews). CMD achieves a new state-of-the-art performance on most domain adaptation tasks of Office and outperforms networks trained with MMD, Variational Fair Autoencoders and Domain Adversarial Neural Networks on Amazon reviews.

Unlike existing methods which are struggled in noticeable accuracy loss, our INQ has the potential to resolve this issue, as benefiting from two innovations. On one hand, we introduce three interdependent operations, namely weight partition, group-wise quantization and re-training. A well-proven measure is employed to divide the weights in each layer of a pre-trained CNN model into two disjoint groups. The weights in the first group are responsible to form a low-precision base, thus they are quantized by a variable-length encoding method. The weights in the other group are responsible to compensate for the accuracy loss from the quantization, thus they are the ones to be re-trained. On the other hand, these three operations are repeated on the latest re-trained group in an iterative manner until all the weights are converted into low-precision ones, acting as an incremental network quantization and accuracy enhancement procedure. Extensive experiments on the ImageNet classification task using almost all known deep CNN architectures including AlexNet, VGG-16, GoogleNet and ResNets well testify the efficacy of the proposed method. Specifically, at 5-bit quantization (a variable-length encoding: 1 bit for representing zero value, and the remaining 4 bits represent at most 16 different values for the powers of two), our models have improved accuracy than the 32-bit floating-point references. Taking ResNet-18 as an example, we further show that our quantized models with 4-bit, 3-bit and 2-bit ternary weights have improved or very similar accuracy against its 32-bit floating-point baseline. Besides, impressive results with the combination of network pruning and INQ are also reported. We believe that our method sheds new insights on how to make deep CNNs to be applicable on mobile or embedded devices.

ENet is up to 18x faster, requires 75x less FLOPs, has 79x less parameters, and provides similar or better accuracy to existing models.           \nWe have tested it on CamVid, Cityscapes and SUN datasets and report on comparisons with existing state-of-the-art methods, and the trade-offs between accuracy and processing time of a network. We present performance measurements of the proposed architecture on embedded systems and suggest possible software improvements that could make ENet even faster.      \n","pdf":"/pdf/19025e9f9e55430fa57f3730bcf86cc5ad1c73b8.pdf","keywords":["Deep learning"],"conflicts":["mimuw.edu.pl","purdue.edu","hanyang.ac.kr","iitg.ac.in"],"authors":["Adam Paszke","Abhishek Chaurasia","Sangpil Kim","Eugenio Culurciello"],"authorids":["a.paszke@students.mimuw.edu.pl","aabhish@purdue.edu","sangpilkim@purdue.edu","euge@purdue.edu"]},"writers":[],"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":16,"writable":false},{"tddate":null,"replyto":null,"tcdate":1478269500741,"number":177,"tmdate":1481929417291,"id":"SJBr9Mcxl","invitation":"ICLR.cc/2017/conference/-/submission","forum":"SJBr9Mcxl","signatures":["~Ivet_Rafegas_Fonoll1"],"readers":["everyone"],"content":{"TL;DR":"","title":"Understanding trained CNNs by indexing neuron selectivity","abstract":"The impressive performance and plasticity of convolutional neural networks to solve different vision problems are shadowed by their black-box nature and its consequent lack of full understanding.

Our approach is based on the definition of feature selectivity indexes that allow the ranking of neurons according to specific properties. Here we report the results of exploring selectivity indexes for: (a) an image feature (color); and (b) an image label (class membership). Our contribution is a framework to seek or classify neurons by indexing on these selectivity properties. It helps to find color selective neurons, such as a red-mushroom neuron in layer conv4 or class selective neurons such as dog-face neurons in layer conv5, and establishes a methodology to derive other selectivity properties.  Indexing on neuron selectivity can statistically draw how features and classes are represented through layers at a moment when the size of trained nets is growing and automatic tools to index can be helpful.

Batch policy gradient methods offer stable learning, but at the cost of high variance, which often requires large batches, while TD-style methods, such as off-policy actor-critic and Q-learning, are more sample-efficient but biased, and often require costly hyperparameter sweeps to stabilize. In this work, we aim to develop methods that combine the stability of policy gradients with the efficiency of off-policy RL.

Q-Prop is both sample efficient and stable, and effectively combines the benefits of on-policy and off-policy methods. We analyze the connection between Q-Prop and existing model-free algorithms, and use control variate theory to derive two variants of Q-Prop with conservative and aggressive adaptation.

But the recursive abstraction that is central to procedural knowledge is perhaps most naturally represented by symbolic representations that have syntactic structure, such as logical expressions and source code. Combining abstract, symbolic reasoning with continuous neural reasoning is a grand challenge of representation learning. As a step in this direction, we propose a new architecture, called neural equivalence networks, for the problem of learning continuous semantic representations of mathematical and logical expressions.

Modelling uncertainty is one of the key features of Bayesian methods. Bayesian DNNs that use dropout-based variational distributions and scale to complex tasks have recently been proposed. We evaluate Bayesian DNNs trained with Bernoulli or Gaussian multiplicative masking of either the units (dropout) or the weights (dropconnect). We compare these Bayesian DNNs ability to represent their uncertainty about their outputs through sampling during inference. We tested the calibration of these Bayesian fully connected and convolutional DNNs on two visual inference tasks (MNIST and CIFAR-10). By adding different levels of Gaussian noise to the test images, we assessed how these DNNs represented their uncertainty about regions of input space not covered by the training set. These Bayesian DNNs represented their own uncertainty more accurately than traditional DNNs with a softmax output. We find that sampling of weights, whether Gaussian or Bernoulli, led to more accurate representation of uncertainty compared to sampling of units. However, sampling units using either Gaussian or Bernoulli dropout led to increased convolutional neural network (CNN) classification accuracy. Based on these findings we use both Bernoulli dropout and Gaussian dropconnect concurrently, which approximates the use of a spike-and-slab variational distribution. We find that networks with spike-and-slab sampling combine the advantages of the other methods: they classify with high accuracy and robustly represent the uncertainty of their classifications for all tested architectures.","pdf":"/pdf/1cfeed8ed6564fce035669688a6580c520ca4129.pdf","TL;DR":"Dropout- and dropconnect-based Bayesian deep neural networks with sampling at inference better represent their own inferential uncertainty than traditional deep neural networks.","conflicts":["cam.ac.uk"],"keywords":["Deep learning","Theory","Applications"],"authors":["Patrick McClure","Nikolaus Kriegeskorte"],"authorids":["Patrick.McClure@mrc-cbu.cam.ac.uk","Nikolaus.Kriegeskorte@mrc-cbu.cam.ac.uk"]},"writers":[],"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":11,"writable":false},{"tddate":null,"replyto":null,"tcdate":1478255299520,"number":160,"tmdate":1484467703330,"id":"Sys6GJqxl","invitation":"ICLR.cc/2017/conference/-/submission","forum":"Sys6GJqxl","signatures":["~Xinyun_Chen1"],"readers":["everyone"],"content":{"TL;DR":"","title":"Delving into Transferable Adversarial Examples and Black-box Attacks","abstract":"An intriguing property of deep neural networks is the existence of adversarial examples, which can transfer among different architectures.

This trains on a dataset distributed across machines while limiting the amount of communication so it does not obliterate the benefit of parallelism.

Only submodel parameters, no data or coordinates, are ever communicated between machines. ParMAC exhibits high parallelism, low communication overhead, and facilitates data shuffling, load balancing, fault tolerance and streaming data processing.

The model is trained using supervised learning techniques, but without extraneous supervision. It learns to act based on raw sensory input from a complex three-dimensional environment. The presented formulation allows changing the agent's goal at test time. We conduct extensive experiments in three-dimensional simulations based on the classical first-person game Doom. The results demonstrate that the presented approach outperforms sophisticated prior formulations, particularly on challenging tasks. The results also show that trained models successfully generalize across environments and goals. A model trained using the presented approach won the Full Deathmatch track of the Visual Doom AI Competition, which was held in previously unseen environments.\n","pdf":"/pdf/16a6db0923bd0f5e6de3d692de0caecdafef63af.pdf","TL;DR":"We present an approach to sensorimotor control in immersive environments.","keywords":[],"conflicts":["intel.com","cs.uni-freiburg.de","stanford.edu"],"authors":["Alexey Dosovitskiy","Vladlen Koltun"],"authorids":["adosovitskiy@gmail.com","vkoltun@gmail.com"]},"writers":[],"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":11,"writable":false},{"tddate":null,"replyto":null,"tcdate":1478233540693,"number":115,"tmdate":1482083111925,"id":"B1TTpYKgx","invitation":"ICLR.cc/2017/conference/-/submission","forum":"B1TTpYKgx","signatures":["~Maithra_Raghu1"],"readers":["everyone"],"content":{"title":"On the Expressive Power of Deep Neural Networks","abstract":"We study the expressive power of deep neural networks before and after\ntraining.

The disambiguation algorithm, which we call $K$-Grassmeans, leads to a procedure to label the different senses of the target word in the corpus -- yielding lexeme vector representations, all in an unsupervised manner starting from a large (Wikipedia) corpus in English.

Unfortunately, even in simple environments, the popular deep Q-network (DQN) algorithm is doomed by a Sisyphean curse. Owing to the use of function approximation, these agents eventually forget experiences as they become exceedingly unlikely under a new policy. Consequently, for as long as they continue to train, DQNs may periodically relive catastrophic mistakes. Many real-world environments where people might be injured exhibit a special structure. We know a priori that catastrophes are not only bad, but that agents need not ever get near to a catastrophe state. In this paper, we exploit this structure to learn a reward-shaping that accelerates learning and guards oscillating policies against repeated catastrophes. First, we demonstrate unacceptable performance of DQNs on two toy problems. We then introduce intrinsic fear, a new method that mitigates these problems by avoiding dangerous states. Our approach incorporates a second model trained via supervised learning to predict the probability of catastrophe within a short number of steps. This score then acts to penalize the Q-learning objective, shaping the reward function away from catastrophic states.","pdf":"/pdf/014eddc2f3365ec7cb0cc28545fb4cb825160465.pdf","TL;DR":"Owing to function approximation, DRL agents eventually forget about dangerous transitions once they learn to avoid them, putting them at risk of perpetually repeating mistakes.

Moreover, suggestion engines in modern IDEs do not propose expressions or multi-statement idiomatic code. Recent work has shown that language models can improve code suggestion systems by learning from software repositories. This paper introduces a neural language model with a sparse pointer network aimed at capturing very long range dependencies. We release a large-scale code suggestion corpus of 41M lines of Python code crawled from GitHub. On this corpus, we found standard neural language models to perform well at suggesting local phenomena, but struggle to refer to identifiers that are introduced many tokens in the past. By augmenting a neural language model with a pointer network specialized in referring to predefined classes of identifiers, we obtain a much lower perplexity and a 5 percentage points increase in accuracy for code suggestion compared to an LSTM baseline. In fact, this increase in code suggestion accuracy is due to a 13 times more accurate prediction of identifiers.

In this paper we study the ability of convolutional networks to model correlations among regions of their input. We theoretically analyze convolutional arithmetic circuits, and empirically validate our findings on other types of convolutional networks as well. Correlations are formalized through the notion of separation rank, which for a given partition of the input, measures how far a function is from being separable. We show that a polynomially sized deep network supports exponentially high separation ranks for certain input partitions, while being limited to polynomial separation ranks for others. The network's pooling geometry effectively determines which input partitions are favored, thus serves as a means for controlling the inductive bias. Contiguous pooling windows as commonly employed in practice favor interleaved partitions over coarse ones, orienting the inductive bias towards the statistics of natural images. Other pooling schemes lead to different preferences, and this allows tailoring the network to data that departs from the usual domain of natural imagery. In addition to analyzing deep networks, we show that shallow ones support only linear separation ranks, and by this gain insight into the benefit of functions brought forth by depth - they are able to efficiently model strong correlation under favored partitions of the input.","pdf":"/pdf/172845f5d68cc6e1b05bc593e048883d5df4e46c.pdf","TL;DR":"We study the ability of convolutional networks to model correlations among regions of their input, showing that this is controlled by shapes of pooling windows.","conflicts":["cs.huji.ac.il"],"keywords":["Theory","Deep learning"],"authors":["Nadav Cohen","Amnon Shashua"],"authorids":["cohennadav@cs.huji.ac.il","shashua@cs.huji.ac.il"]},"writers":[],"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":10,"writable":false},{"tddate":null,"replyto":null,"tcdate":1478202038100,"number":80,"tmdate":1482239646679,"id":"rJRhzzKxl","invitation":"ICLR.cc/2017/conference/-/submission","forum":"rJRhzzKxl","signatures":["~Sebastian_Ruder1"],"readers":["everyone"],"content":{"title":"Knowledge Adaptation: Teaching to Adapt","abstract":"Domain adaptation is crucial in many real-world applications where the distribution of the training data differs from the distribution of the test data. Previous Deep Learning-based approaches to domain adaptation need to be trained jointly on source and target domain data and are therefore unappealing in scenarios where models need to be adapted to a large number of domains or where a domain is evolving, e.g. spam detection where attackers continuously change their tactics.\n\nTo fill this gap, we propose Knowledge Adaptation, an extension of Knowledge Distillation (Bucilua et al., 2006; Hinton et al., 2015) to the domain adaptation scenario.

FABIA is a generative model that represents each bicluster by two sparse membership vectors: one for the samples and one for the features. However, FABIA is restricted to about 20 code units because of the high computational complexity of computing the posterior. Furthermore, code units are sometimes insufficiently decorrelated. Sample membership is difficult to determine because vectors do not have exact zero entries and can have both large positive and large negative values.\n\nWe propose to use the recently introduced unsupervised Deep Learning approach Rectified Factor Networks (RFNs) to overcome the drawbacks of existing biclustering methods. RFNs efficiently construct very sparse, non-linear, high-dimensional representations of the input via their posterior means. RFN learning is a generalized alternating minimization algorithm based on the posterior regularization method which enforces non-negative and normalized posterior means. Each code unit represents a bicluster, where samples for which the code unit is active belong to the bicluster and features that have activating weights to the code unit belong to the bicluster.\n\nOn 400 benchmark datasets with artificially implanted biclusters, RFN significantly outperformed 13 other biclustering competitors including FABIA. In biclustering experiments on three gene expression datasets with known clusters that were determined by separate measurements, RFN biclustering was two times significantly better than the other 13 methods and once on second place.

Under the deep learning framework, generalization performance highly depends on the learned latent representation. In this work, we propose a novel latent space modeling method to learn better latent representation. We designed a neural network model based on the assumption that good base representation for supervised tasks can be attained by maximizing the sum of hierarchical mutual informations between the input, latent, and output variables. From this base model, we introduce a semantic noise modeling method which enables semantic perturbation on the latent space to enhance the representational power of learned latent feature. During training, latent vector representation can be stochastically perturbed by a modeled additive noise while preserving its original semantics.

Unlike previous methods which factorize a weight matrix into multiple real-valued matrices, our method factorizes both weights and activations into integer and noninteger components. In our method, the real-valued weight matrix is approximated by a multiplication of a ternary matrix and a real-valued co-efficient matrix. Since the ternary matrix consists of three integer values, {-1, 0, +1}, it only consumes 2 bits per element. At test-time, an activation vector that passed from a previous layer is also transformed into a weighted sum of binary vectors, {-1, +1}, which enables fast feed-forward propagation based on simple logical operations: AND, XOR, and bit count. This makes it easier to deploy a deep network on low-power CPUs or to design specialized hardware.\nIn our experiments, we tested our method on three different networks: a CNN for handwritten digits, VGG-16 model for ImageNet classification, and VGG-Face for large-scale face recognition. In particular, when we applied our method to three fully connected layers in the VGG-16, 15x acceleration and memory compression up to 5.2% were achieved with only a 1.43% increase in the top-5 error. Our experiments also revealed that compressing convolutional layers can accelerate inference of the entire network in exchange of slight increase in error.","pdf":"/pdf/de3d7a3678c6bd1f250b4066a8f2fd0b0b9da868.pdf","keywords":["Deep learning"],"conflicts":["chubu.ac.jp","d-itlab.co.jp","denso.co.jp","kumamoto-u.ac.jp"],"authors":["Mitsuru Ambai","Takuya Matsumoto","Takayoshi Yamashita","Hironobu Fujiyoshi"],"authorids":["manbai@d-itlab.co.jp","tmatsumoto@d-itlab.co.jp","yamashita@cs.chubu.ac.jp","hf@cs.chubu.ac.jp"]},"writers":[],"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":7,"writable":false},{"tddate":null,"replyto":null,"tcdate":1478076656020,"number":42,"tmdate":1484285247414,"id":"ryuxYmvel","invitation":"ICLR.cc/2017/conference/-/submission","forum":"ryuxYmvel","signatures":["~Cezary_Kaliszyk1"],"readers":["everyone"],"content":{"TL;DR":"","title":"HolStep: A Machine Learning Dataset for Higher-order Logic Theorem Proving","abstract":"Large computer-understandable proofs consist of millions of intermediate\nlogical steps.

Most current single image SR methods use empirical risk minimisation, often with a pixel-wise mean squared error (MSE) loss.\nHowever, the outputs from such methods tend to be blurry, over-smoothed and generally appear implausible. A more desirable approach would employ Maximum a Posteriori (MAP) inference, preferring solutions that always have a high probability under the image prior, and thus appear more plausible. Direct MAP estimation for SR is non-trivial, as it requires us to build a model for the image prior from samples. Here we introduce new methods for \\emph{amortised MAP inference} whereby we calculate the MAP estimate directly using a convolutional neural network. We first introduce a novel neural network architecture that performs a projection to the affine subspace of valid SR solutions ensuring that the high resolution output of the network is always consistent with the low resolution input. We show that, using this architecture, the amortised MAP inference problem reduces to minimising the cross-entropy between two distributions, similar to training generative models. We propose three methods to solve this optimisation problem: (1) Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) (2) denoiser-guided SR which backpropagates gradient-estimates from denoising to train the network, and (3) a baseline method using a maximum-likelihood-trained image prior.

In this paper, we propose a novel multiscale approach, called the hierarchical multiscale recurrent neural network, that can capture the latent hierarchical structure in the sequence by encoding the temporal dependencies with different timescales using a novel update mechanism.

In this work, we first formulate dropout as a tractable approximation of some latent variable model, leading to a clean view of parameter sharing and enabling further theoretical analysis. Then, we introduce (approximate) expectation-linear dropout neural networks, whose inference gap we are able to formally characterize. Algorithmically, we show that our proposed measure of the inference gap can be used to regularize the standard dropout training objective, resulting in an explicit control of the gap. Our method is as simple and efficient as standard dropout. We further prove the upper bounds on the loss in accuracy due to expectation-linearization, describe classes of input distributions that expectation-linearize easily. Experiments on three image classification benchmark datasets demonstrate that reducing the inference gap can indeed improve the performance consistently.","pdf":"/pdf/46f0808b5356cb80896d9f58cac17d72acc7c475.pdf","conflicts":["cs.cmu.edu"],"keywords":["Deep learning","Theory","Supervised Learning"],"authors":["Xuezhe Ma","Yingkai Gao","Zhiting Hu","Yaoliang Yu","Yuntian Deng","Eduard Hovy"],"authorids":["xuezhem@cs.cmu.edu","yingkaig@cs.cmu.edu","zhitinghu@cs.cmu.edu","yaoliang@cs.cmu.edu","dengyuntian@gmail.com","hovy@cmu.edu"]},"writers":[],"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":10,"writable":false},{"ddate":null,"cdate":null,"tddate":null,"replyto":null,"tcdate":1477541588899,"number":8,"tmdate":1483432143100,"id":"rkpACe1lx","invitation":"ICLR.cc/2017/conference/-/submission","forum":"rkpACe1lx","signatures":["~David_Ha1"],"readers":["everyone"],"content":{"title":"HyperNetworks","abstract":"This work explores hypernetworks: an approach of using one network, also known as a hypernetwork, to generate the weights for another network.

In this paper we introduce a new form of regularization that guides the learning problem in a way that reduces over-fitting without sacrificing the capacity of the model. The mistakes that models make in early stages of training carry information about the learning problem. By adjusting the labels of the current epoch of training through a weighted average of the real labels, and an exponential average of the past soft-targets we achieved a regularization scheme as powerful as Dropout without necessarily reducing the capacity of the model, and simplified the complexity of the learning problem.
